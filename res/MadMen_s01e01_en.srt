1
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,471
Finished, sir?

2
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:16,140
Yeah. Hey, do you have a light?

3
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,320
Old Gold man, huh?

4
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,423
Lucky Strike here.

5
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,631
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you smoke Old Gold?

6
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:35,066
I'm sorry, sir.
Is Sam here bothering you?

7
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:37,729
He can be a little chatty.

8
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,205
No, we're actually just
having a conversation.

9
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,206
Is that okay?

10
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,971
Can I get you another drink?

11
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,138
Yeah. Do this again.
Old-fashioned, please.

12
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:52,145
So you obviously need to relax
after working here all night.

13
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:54,483
I guess. I don't know.

14
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:55,988
But what is it? I mean, low-tar?

15
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,988
Those new filters?

16
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,524
Why... I mean... Why Old Gold?

17
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,821
They gave 'em to us in the service...

18
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,418
a carton a week for free.

19
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,191
So you're used to 'em,
is that it?

20
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,995
Yeah. They're a habit.

21
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:09,001
I could never get you
to try another brand...

22
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:10,934
say, my Luckies?

23
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,167
I love my Old Golds.

24
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:17,870
All right, well, let's just say tomorrow
a tobacco weevil comes

25
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,948
and eats every last
Old Gold on the planet.

26
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:22,778
That's a sad story.

27
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:25,682
It's a tragedy.

28
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:27,220
Would you just stop smoking?

29
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,851
I think I could find something.

30
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,323
I love smoking.

31
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:34,952
"I love smoking. " That's very good.

32
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:36,690
My wife hates it.

33
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,857
<i>Reader's Digest says it will kill you.</i>

34
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,195
Yeah, I heard about that.

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,904
Ladies love their magazines.

36
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,440
Yes, they do.

37
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:22,067
You weren't worried
about waking me, were you?

38
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,507
Am I interrupting anything?

39
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:24,839
Mmm, no.

40
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,752
You're lucky I'm still up working
and I'm alone.

41
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,253
How's it going?

42
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:37,916
They invented something called
Grandmother's Day.

43
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:42,928
That ought to keep me busy
drawing puppies for a few months.

44
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,930
Can I run a few ideas past you?

45
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:46,863
Does that mean
what I think it means?

46
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,994
Because I'm familiar
with most of your ideas.

47
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,299
I'm having a situation
with my cigarette account.

48
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,808
Wow, you really are here to talk.

49
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,811
The Trade Commission is cracking down
on all of our health claims.

50
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:00,972
<i>I get Reader's Digest.</i>

51
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:03,573
This is the same scare
you had five years ago.

52
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:04,810
You dealt with it.

53
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,320
I know I slept a lot better
knowing doctors smoke.

54
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,355
Well, that's just it.

55
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,585
The whole "safer cigarette"
thing is over.

56
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,661
No more doctors,
no more testimonials,

57
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:18,163
no more cough-free,
soothes your T-zone,

58
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,325
low-tar, low-nicotine, filter tip.

59
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:21,993
Nothing.

60
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:24,697
All I have is a crush-proof box

61
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,333
and "four out of five
dead people smoke your brand. "

62
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,001
Is this the part where I say,

63
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:33,103
"Don Draper is the greatest ad man ever,

64
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:36,149
"and his big, strong brain will find a way

65
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,411
to lead the sheep
to the slaughterhouse"?

66
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,954
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

67
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,355
You gonna pitch to me or not?

68
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,088
Midge, I'm serious. I have nothing.

69
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,130
I am over, and they're
finally gonna know it.

70
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,289
Next time you see me,

71
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,889
there will be a bunch
of young executives

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,092
picking meat off my ribs.

73
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,432
That's a pretty picture.

74
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,168
What's your secret?

75
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:05,978
Nine different ways to say...

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,538
"I love you, Grandma. "

77
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:30,062
We should get married.

78
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,572
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?

79
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:36,074
I'm serious.

80
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,576
You have your own business.

81
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:41,409
You don't mind when I come over.

82
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:43,143
What size Cadillac do you take?

83
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,380
You know the rules.

84
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:47,647
I don't make plans,

85
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:50,087
and I don't make breakfast.

86
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,828
Sterling's having the tobacco people in
in nine hours, and I have nothing.

87
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:03,101
People love smoking.

88
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,264
There's nothing that you,
the Trade Commission,

89
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:09,605
<i>or Reader's Digest
can do to change that.</i>

90
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:18,114
There's this kid who comes
by my office every day,

91
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,119
looks where he's gonna put his plants.

92
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:22,584
Is he handsome?

93
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:44,977
23.

94
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,068
Uh, not right away.

95
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,807
Pal, could you take the long way up?

96
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:50,349
I am really enjoying the view here.

97
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,611
You going to Campbell's
bachelor party?

98
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:52,845
Yeah, I want to be there

99
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,980
before they tie an anchor around his neck
and drag him out to sea.

100
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,387
I hear she's a nice girl.

101
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:58,685
Eh, who wants that?

102
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,823
What did you do that for?

103
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,696
She'll probably be
assigned to one of us.

104
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,463
Then she'll know what she's in for.

105
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,629
You got to let them know
what kind of guy you are.

106
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,297
Then they'll know what kind of girl to be.

107
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,274
I have a feeling we won't be going
to your bachelor party soon.

108
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:19,642
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a Boy Scout.

109
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,146
Excuse me. Is he expecting you?

110
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,442
He's not expecting anything.

111
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,281
Oh, honey, don't worry.
I'll get home safely.

112
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,247
I have an important
appointment right now,

113
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:32,326
so why don't you go
shopping or something?

114
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:34,053
Take your mother to lunch.

115
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,492
Tell her it was my idea.

116
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,257
Wow. He's good.

117
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:40,425
It's just a bachelor party, dear.

118
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:43,094
No, I really don't know
what they have planned,

119
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,399
but judging from the creative brain power
around here,

120
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,565
<i>we'll probably end up
seeing My Fair Lady.</i>

121
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,143
I'll tell you what.

122
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,076
I'll drop by your place on my way home.

123
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,545
Your mother can check
under my fingernails.

124
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:59,013
Of course I love you.

125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,180
I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?

126
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,092
What a great gal.

127
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:10,727
Tell ya, boys,

128
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,458
she stole my heart.

129
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,193
And her old man's loaded.

130
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,565
Now, this is the executive floor.

131
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,664
It should be organized, but it's not,

132
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:25,007
so you'll find account executives
and creative executives all mixed in together.

133
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,374
Please don't ask me the difference.

134
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,378
Great.

135
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,039
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,

136
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,084
you can avoid some of the mistakes
I've made here.

137
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,846
- Hello, Joan.
- Like that one.

138
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,490
So how many trains did it take you?

139
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,558
Only one, but I got up very early.

140
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,217
In a couple of years,
with the right moves,

141
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:42,318
you'll be in the city with the rest of us.

142
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,159
Of course, if you really make
the right moves,

143
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,323
you'll be out in the country,

144
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,197
and you won't be going to work at all.

145
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,826
You'll be here just
across the aisle from me.

146
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:52,405
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper
for the time being.

147
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:55,839
I don't know what your goals are,
but don't overdo it with the perfume.

148
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:58,002
Keep a fifth of something
in your desk.

149
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,670
Mr. Draper drinks rye.

150
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,840
Also, invest in some
aspirin, Band-Aids,

151
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,884
and a needle and thread.

152
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:05,917
Rye is Canadian, right?

153
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,715
You better find out.

154
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:10,421
He may act like he wants a secretary,

155
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,752
but most of the time,

156
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,692
they're looking for something
between a mother and a waitress.

157
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,422
And the rest of the time, well...

158
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:23,364
Go home, take a paper bag,

159
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:25,029
and cut some eyeholes out of it.

160
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,868
Put it over your head, get undressed,

161
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,635
and look at yourself in the mirror.

162
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:31,871
Really evaluate where your strengths
and weaknesses are,

163
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,378
and be honest.

164
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:35,472
I always try to be honest.

165
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,312
Good for you.

166
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:41,279
Now, try not to be overwhelmed
by all this technology.

167
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:42,377
It looks complicated,

168
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,186
but the men who designed it made it
simple enough for a woman to use.

169
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,384
I sure hope so.

170
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,621
At lunch, pick up a box of chocolates,

171
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:50,356
a dozen carnations,
and some bath salts.

172
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,396
I'll explain later.

173
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:52,966
Thank you, Miss Holloway.

174
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,558
You're really wonderful
for looking out for me this way.

175
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,102
It's Joan.

176
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:59,001
And listen,

177
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,767
don't take this the wrong way,

178
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,742
but a girl like you,
with those darling little ankles,

179
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,641
I'd find a way to make 'em sing.

180
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,579
Also, men love scarves.

181
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,173
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

182
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,847
Oh! And Mr. Sterling. How are you?

183
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:15,922
Morning, girls.

184
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:21,693
You look like a hundred bucks.
Long night?

185
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,320
It's not this tobacco thing, is it?

186
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,863
It's been on my mind.

187
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:26,432
Yeah, well, I should hope so.

188
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:27,592
Lee Garner, his father,

189
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,601
the whole Lucky Strike family
will be here at 4.

190
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,996
You worried?

191
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:34,438
No.

192
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,373
If I was worried,
I'd ask you what you've got,

193
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:39,310
but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume
you've got something,

194
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,381
which means you should be worried.

195
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,950
So you came here because you wanted
to watch me get dressed?

196
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,611
No, I wanted to make sure
you were here.

197
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,622
In body. Give me about a half hour
for the rest of it.

198
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,786
How do I put this?

199
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,362
Have we ever hired any Jews?

200
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:57,828
Not on my watch.

201
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:00,799
That's very funny. It's not what I meant.

202
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:04,132
We've got an Italian.
Salvatore, my art director.

203
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:06,365
- That won't work.
- Sorry.

204
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,498
Most of the Jewish guys
work for the Jewish firms.

205
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:09,803
Yeah, I know.

206
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,309
Selling Jewish products to Jewish people.

207
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,640
That's very good.

208
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,907
It's just that our 11:00
is with Menken's Department Store

209
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,212
and I wish we had someone
to make them feel... comfortable.

210
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,947
You want me to run
down to the deli and grab somebody?

211
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:23,549
You missed a button.

212
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:13,864
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.

213
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,407
Still trying to fill out that bikini?

214
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,238
Summer's coming.

215
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:19,471
Without the medical claims,

216
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,574
all we have is a white box
with a red spot on it.

217
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,209
My neighbor posed for that.

218
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,653
Believe me, he always
looks very relaxed.

219
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,156
Of course, he doesn't smoke.

220
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,350
Had him hold a pencil.

221
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,223
If I know these guys,
you're better off with a little sex appeal.

222
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:37,229
Can you give me a woman
in a bathing suit,

223
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,423
put her next to your guy?

224
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,659
A sexy girl? I can do that.

225
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:42,395
Give you a chance
to get a real model.

226
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,801
Oh, I love my work.

227
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,395
Speaking of sexy girls,

228
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:48,304
are you going to Pete's bachelor party?

229
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,070
I'm not really big on those things.

230
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,577
Tell me about it. It's so embarrassing.

231
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,238
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,

232
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:56,339
I want to be alone so I can do something.

233
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,815
Should we drink before
the meeting or after?

234
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:03,253
Or both?

235
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,918
So... that's it, huh? Relax?

236
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,585
Don't be short with me.

237
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,095
You're the writer.

238
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:12,495
I thought it was worth a try.

239
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,328
<i>Greta Guttman is here to see you.</i>

240
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:15,333
Send her in.

241
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:16,528
Oh, great.

242
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,696
Now we get to hear from our man in research.

243
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,272
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,

244
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,778
you both seemed more relaxed
than I expected.

245
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,474
Do you have some kind of surprise
for the tobacco people?

246
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,380
I'm doing my own research.

247
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:33,453
If you're planning to continue
with medical testimony,

248
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:36,614
you'll only be inviting
further government interference.

249
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:37,952
We must police ourselves.

250
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,821
- There's your slogan.
- The medical thing is dead.

251
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:40,859
We understand that.

252
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,122
Yes, dead. An apt choice of words,

253
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,358
considering the public is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous.

254
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,900
If we can't insist that they're not,

255
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:50,596
I believe my most recent surveys
have provided a solution.

256
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,434
We can still suggest
that cigarettes are part of American life,

257
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,201
or too good to give up,

258
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,903
or, most appealing,
an assertion of independence.

259
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:00,242
So, basically, if you love danger,
you'll love smoking.

260
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,679
We can put a skull
and crossbones on the label.

261
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:03,750
I love it.

262
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:05,478
Before the war,

263
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:07,383
when I studied with Adler in Vienna,

264
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,718
we postulated that what Freud called
the death wish

265
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:11,051
is as powerful a drive

266
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:13,683
as those for sexual reproduction
and physical sustenance.

267
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,819
Freud, you say?

268
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:16,896
What agency is he with?

269
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:20,660
So we're supposed to believe
that people are all living one way

270
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,895
and secretly thinking
the exact opposite?

271
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,493
That's ridiculous.

272
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:26,596
Let me tell you something,
Miss Guttman...

273
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:28,004
Doctor.

274
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,008
Dr. Guttman.

275
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,045
Psychology might be great
at cocktail parties,

276
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:37,982
but it so happens that people were
buying cigarettes before Freud was born.

277
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,212
The issue here isn't
why should people smoke.

278
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,346
It's why should people
smoke Lucky Strike.

279
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,857
Suggesting that our customers have a...

280
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,689
What did you call it? A death wish?

281
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,661
I just don't see that on a billboard.

282
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,528
<i>So what if Reader's Digest
says they're dangerous?</i>

283
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,761
<i>They also said Bambi
was the book of the century.</i>

284
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:56,767
There's no proof.

285
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,497
There's conclusive proof

286
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,972
that none of these low-tar,
low-nicotine, or filtration systems

287
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:04,408
have any effect on the incidences
of lung cancer.

288
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:06,240
Just give me the damn report.

289
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,541
I think you'll find it very convincing.

290
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:09,946
I'm sure I will.

291
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,176
You're the one who found

292
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,253
all of our medical testimonials
in the first place.

293
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,547
That's true, Mr. Draper, but I...

294
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,145
Has anyone else seen this?

295
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:17,450
Of course not. It's your account.

296
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:18,820
Good.

297
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,390
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

298
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,964
I'm sorry. I just find your whole
approach perverse.

299
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,569
Good luck at the meeting.

300
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,729
I'm sure it will be a quick one.

301
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,312
Sal, I'll take that drink now.

302
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,848
Mr. Draper.

303
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,918
Excuse me.

304
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,150
Mr. Draper.

305
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,626
I'm sorry to wake you,
but Mr. Campbell is outside.

306
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:32,456
He doesn't know I'm sleeping in here, does he?

307
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:33,464
No, sir.

308
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,694
That's good.

309
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,700
Who are you?

310
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:39,203
I'm Peggy Olsen, the new girl.

311
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:47,372
Can you go out there
and entertain him?

312
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:52,315
I know it's my first day,
and I don't want to seem uncooperative,

313
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,115
but do I have to?

314
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:57,384
I see your point.

315
00:16:58,425 --> 00:16:59,949
I brought you some aspirin.

316
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,959
Send him in.

317
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,562
You look like a hundred bucks.

318
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,535
Ready to go sweet-talk
some retail Jews?

319
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,232
You are tough to take
first thing in the morning, Pete.

320
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:15,706
I've never had any complaints.

321
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,743
Speaking of which,
who's your little friend here?

322
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,573
She's the new girl.

323
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,511
You always get the new girl.

324
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:23,344
Management gets all the perks.

325
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:25,612
Where are you from, honey?

326
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,914
Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

327
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,420
Top notch.

328
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:30,717
But I meant where are you from?

329
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:33,918
Are you Amish or something?

330
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,928
No. I'm from Brooklyn.

331
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,190
Well, you're in the city now.

332
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,266
It wouldn't be a sin
for us to see your legs.

333
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,892
If you pull your waist in,
you might look like a woman.

334
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,766
Is that all, Mr. Draper?

335
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,634
Hey, I'm not done here.

336
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,798
I'm working my way up.

337
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:49,375
That will be all.

338
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,636
Peggy, right?

339
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:52,109
Yes.

340
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:54,703
Oh, and it's time for
your 11:00 meeting.

341
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:56,806
Oh, and sorry about Mr. Campbell here.

342
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,817
He left his manners
back at the fraternity house.

343
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:05,320
She's a little young for you, Draper.

344
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:07,290
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell
is a very lucky woman.

345
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:08,383
When's the wedding again?

346
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:11,191
Sunday. Did Ken tell you
about the bachelor party tonight?

347
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,322
He sure did.

348
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:13,831
So do I get first crack at her?

349
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,459
<i>Word is she took down more sailors
than The Arizona.</i>

350
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,128
How old are you, Pete?

351
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,603
I just turned 26.

352
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:22,971
I bet the whole world looks like
one great big brassiere strap

353
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:24,236
just waiting to be snapped, huh?

354
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,676
You are good with words, Draper.

355
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,305
Campbell, we're both men here,
so I'm gonna be direct.

356
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,078
Christ, are you already
sleeping with her?

357
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:34,153
Advertising is a very small world,

358
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,620
and when you do something
like malign the reputation

359
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,351
of a girl from the steno pool
on her first day,

360
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,120
you make it even smaller.

361
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:45,597
Keep it up, and even if you do get my job,
you'll never run this place.

362
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,291
You'll die in that corner office,

363
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,392
a mid-level executive
with a little bit of hair

364
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,368
who women go home with out of pity.

365
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:55,100
Want to know why?

366
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,176
Because no one will like you.

367
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,544
Oh! Here are our miracle-workers now.

368
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:07,950
You know Pete Campbell, of course,

369
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,023
your account executive
if you choose to do business with us.

370
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,988
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,

371
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,252
the best creative director in New York.

372
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,487
Well, at least the building.
Pleasure to meet you.

373
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:17,786
Oop. Sorry about that.

374
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:19,957
I'm Rachel Menken.

375
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,558
Oh. Uh, sorry. I was expecting...

376
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,694
You were expecting me to be a man.

377
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:26,033
My father was, too.

378
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,200
And you are?

379
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:34,540
Why, Don, you remember David Cohen
from the art department.

380
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,275
Of course! David.

381
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,874
One of the rising stars
here at Sterling Cooper.

382
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:41,010
Well, why don't we make
ourselves comfortable?

383
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:43,214
And, Miss Menken, you can tell us
what you have in mind.

384
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:44,381
Wonderful.

385
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,859
That's very subtle.

386
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:48,985
Isn't that your shirt?

387
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:52,031
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,
but I found one.

388
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:17,689
So you must be Peggy Olsen.

389
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:21,323
Joan Holloway sent you over.

390
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,952
She's a great girl. How is Joan?

391
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,621
She sends her regards.

392
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:26,130
She's a lot of fun.

393
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,962
Must be a scream to work with her.

394
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,195
Yes, it's pretty terrific.

395
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:34,704
Try to make yourself comfortable.

396
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:35,832
Relax.

397
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,087
I see from your chart, and your finger,
that you're not married.

398
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:49,917
That's right.

399
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,821
And yet you're interested
in the contraceptive pills.

400
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:55,419
Well, I was...

401
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,224
No reason to be nervous.

402
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,525
Joan sent you to me
because I'm not here to judge you.

403
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,328
There's nothing wrong
with a woman being practical

404
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:03,460
about the possibility of sexual activity.

405
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,867
Spread your knees.

406
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,636
That's good to hear.

407
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:09,470
Although, as a doctor,

408
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,840
I'd like to think that putting a woman
in this situation

409
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:15,437
is not gonna turn her
into some kind of strumpet.

410
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,608
Slide your fanny toward me.
I'm not gonna bite.

411
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,955
I'll warn you now,

412
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:32,156
I will take you off this medicine if you abuse it.

413
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:33,892
It's for your own good, really.

414
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:38,766
But the fact is,
even in our modern times,

415
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:42,638
easy women don't find husbands.

416
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,778
I understand, Dr. Emerson.

417
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,246
I really am a very responsible person.

418
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,477
Well, I'm sure you're not
that kind of girl.

419
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:54,178
Now, Joan...

420
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:56,517
I'm just kidding along here.
You can get dressed.

421
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:03,227
I'm gonna write you
a prescription for Enovid.

422
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,230
They're $11 a month,

423
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:07,800
but don't think you have to go out
and become the town pump

424
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,461
just to get your money's worth.

425
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,696
Excuse my French.

426
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:18,506
So what Don is saying
is that through a variety of media,

427
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,273
<i>including a spot during
The Danny Thomas Show,</i>

428
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,974
if you can afford it,
we could really boost awareness.

429
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,280
Then, a 10% off coupon
in select ladies' magazines

430
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,320
will increase your first-time visitors.

431
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:30,150
Once we get them into the store,

432
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:34,023
the rest... is kind of up to you.

433
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,254
Mr. Draper, our store is 60 years old.

434
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:38,490
We share a wall with Tiffany's.

435
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:40,156
Honestly, a coupon?

436
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,996
Miss Menken, coupons work.

437
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,799
I think your father would
agree with the strategy.

438
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,669
He might, but he's not here

439
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:51,369
because we just
had our lowest sales year ever.

440
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:54,641
So I suppose what I think
matters most right now.

441
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:58,416
Miss Menken, why did you come here?

442
00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:03,387
There are a dozen other agencies
better suited to your... needs.

443
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,824
If I wanted some man who happened
to be from the same... village as my father

444
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,259
to manage my account,

445
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:10,590
I could have stayed where I was.

446
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:13,063
Their research favors coupons, too.

447
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,526
It's not just research, Miss Menken.

448
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,126
Housewives love coupons.

449
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:19,830
I'm not interested in housewives.

450
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,238
What kind of people do you want?

451
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,469
I want your kind of people, Mr. Draper:

452
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:26,102
People who don't care about coupons,

453
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:27,406
whether or not they can afford it.

454
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:29,914
People who are coming to the store
because it is expensive.

455
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:33,042
We obviously have very different ideas.

456
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,849
Yes, like the customer is always right?

457
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,915
Gentlemen, I really thought
you could do better than this.

458
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,790
Sterling Cooper has a reputation
for being innovative.

459
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,091
Miss, you are way out of line.

460
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:46,130
Don, please.

461
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:47,494
Let's not get emotional here.

462
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,034
There's no reason
we can't talk this out.

463
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,898
Talk out what? This silly idea

464
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:53,234
that people are gonna come
to some store they've never been to

465
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,602
because it's more expensive?

466
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,005
It works for Chanel.

467
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,508
Menken's is not Chanel.

468
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:59,340
That's a vote of confidence.

469
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,175
What Don's saying is,

470
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:03,181
Chanel is a very different kind of place.

471
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:06,446
It's French, it's continental, it's...

472
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,316
Not just another
Jewish department store?

473
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:09,615
Exactly.

474
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,315
You were right, Roger.

475
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:13,824
This place really runs on charm.

476
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:15,622
- This is ridiculous.
- Don.

477
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:17,822
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

478
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:20,491
This meeting is over.
Good luck, Miss Menken.

479
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,741
Hey, Don, I don't blame you.

480
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,178
She was way out of line.

481
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:38,011
Adding money and education
doesn't take the rude edge out of people.

482
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:41,952
Roger's not gonna be happy,
so I guess that's good for you.

483
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:45,115
I'm not gonna pretend I don't want your job,
but you were right.

484
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:48,058
I'm not great with people, and you are.

485
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:50,629
I mean, not counting
that meeting we were just in.

486
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,961
So I'm kind of counting
on you to help me out.

487
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,092
There's plenty of room at the top.

488
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:02,566
Look, I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before.

489
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:04,974
It's just this damn tobacco thing.

490
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:07,171
You'll think of something.
A man like you

491
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,475
I'd follow into combat blindfolded,

492
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:10,981
and I wouldn't be the first.

493
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:12,449
Am I right, buddy?

494
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,812
Let's take it a little slower.

495
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:17,719
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

496
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,125
Fuck you.

497
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,297
Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?

498
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,733
He seemed nice.

499
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:32,464
He has a place in South Hampton.

500
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,632
I'm not saying that I've seen it,
but it's beautiful.

501
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,334
Now, don't be nervous,

502
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:41,073
but this is the nerve center of the office.

503
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:44,582
You and your boss rely on the willing
and cheerful cooperation

504
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:46,618
of a few skilled employees.

505
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,123
Never snap, yell,
or be sarcastic with them.

506
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:54,352
And above all, always be a supplicant.

507
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,632
I know you girls are busy,
but we've got a new one.

508
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:05,227
Peggy, this is Marge, Nanette, and Ivy.

509
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,272
I brought you some things.

510
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,308
I guess a sort of
"getting to know you" gift.

511
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,576
Well, aren't you a sweetheart?

512
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,545
If I know Joan, the candy's for me.

513
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:16,979
Joan, you're not fair.

514
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,449
You know she has to lose 8 pounds
by the Christmas party.

515
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:21,486
I think you look great.

516
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,522
Yeah, it's because I'm sitting down.

517
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,523
You can come back and visit
any time you want, honey.

518
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,785
Who does she work for?

519
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:28,190
Don Draper.

520
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,488
They got rid of Eleanor?

521
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:31,120
She moved on.

522
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:33,131
Draper wasn't interested.

523
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,894
Well, she couldn't get a call through.

524
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:36,298
Rude little thing.

525
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:37,960
We see that you've got your hands full.

526
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,504
Don't want to be a bother.

527
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:40,504
Nice meeting you.

528
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:41,539
Hey, you have great legs.

529
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,040
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them

530
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,077
if he could see them.

531
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:47,373
Sterling Cooper.
How may I direct your call?

532
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,580
I just don't know what we have to do
to make these government interlopers happy.

533
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:58,020
They tell us to make a safer cigarette,
we do it,

534
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:00,490
and then suddenly that's not good enough.

535
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,322
Might as well be living in Russia.

536
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:04,829
Damn straight.

537
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,760
You know, this morning I got a call

538
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:14,032
from my competitors
at Brown & Williamson,

539
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,438
and they're getting sued
by the federal government

540
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,238
because of the health claims they made.

541
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,811
Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,

542
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:21,141
but you have to realize

543
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:23,112
that through the manipulation
of the mass media,

544
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:24,478
the public is under the impression

545
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:30,318
that your cigarettes are linked to...
certain fatal diseases.

546
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,084
Manipulation of the media?

547
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,853
Hell, that's what I pay you for.

548
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,895
Our product is fine.
I smoke 'em myself.

549
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,931
My granddad smoked 'em.
He died at 95 years old.

550
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,364
He was hit by a truck.

551
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,833
I understand. But our hands are tied.

552
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:46,701
We're no longer allowed to advertise
that Lucky Strikes are safe.

553
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:48,239
So what the hell are we gonna do?

554
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:50,866
We've already funded
our own tobacco research center

555
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:52,808
to put this whole rumor to rest.

556
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:54,504
And that's a very good start.

557
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:57,208
But it may not affect sales.

558
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,486
Don, I think maybe that's your cue.

559
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:04,949
Well, uh...

560
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,117
I have been, uh...

561
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:10,522
thinking quite a bit about this,

562
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,188
and, uh...

563
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:28,175
I mean, you know I'm a Lucky Strike man
from way back, so...

564
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:36,917
I might have a solution.

565
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:42,321
At Sterling Cooper, we've been pioneering
the burgeoning field of research,

566
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:46,091
and our analysis shows that the health risks
associated with your product

567
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,723
is not the end of the world.

568
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,429
People get in their cars
every day to go to work,

569
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:53,801
and some of them die.

570
00:28:53,907 --> 00:28:56,239
Cars are dangerous.

571
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,970
There's nothing you can do about it.

572
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:00,841
You still have to get where you're going.

573
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,546
Cigarettes are exactly the same,

574
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,619
so why don't we simply say,

575
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,017
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?

576
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,555
"You're a man.

577
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:11,851
"The world is dangerous.

578
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,324
"Smoke your cigarette.

579
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:16,827
You still have to get where you're going. "

580
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:20,928
That's very interesting.

581
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:23,969
I mean, if cigarettes were dangerous,

582
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,002
it would be interesting.

583
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,628
Except they aren't.

584
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:28,400
That's your slogan?

585
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:31,068
"You're going to die anyway. Die with us"?

586
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:34,374
Actually, it's a fairly well-established
psychological principle

587
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,745
that society has a death wish,

588
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,250
and if we could just tap into that,

589
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:41,718
the market potential is...

590
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,379
What the hell are you talking about?

591
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,786
Are you insane?

592
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:46,188
I'm not selling rifles here.

593
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,157
I'm in the tobacco business.

594
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:49,694
We're selling America.

595
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:52,697
The Indians gave it to us, for shit's sake.

596
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,266
Come on, Dad.

597
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:55,732
Let's get out of here.

598
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,002
The bright spot is at least we know

599
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:02,904
if we have this problem,
everybody has this problem.

600
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:17,722
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I just say something?

601
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:20,850
I don't know, Don. Can you?

602
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,626
<i>The Federal Trade Commission
and Reader's Digest</i>

603
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,200
have done you a favor.

604
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,030
They've let you know that
any ad that brings up

605
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:34,004
the concept of cigarettes
and health together...

606
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:37,076
Well, it's just gonna
make people think of cancer.

607
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:39,906
Yes, and we're grateful to them.

608
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:44,609
But what Lee, Jr., said is right.

609
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:49,879
If you can't make those health claims,
neither can your competitors.

610
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:55,928
So we've got a lot of people
not saying anything that sells cigarettes.

611
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,121
Not exactly.

612
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,929
This is the greatest advertising opportunity
since the invention of cereal.

613
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:07,235
We have six identical companies
making six identical products.

614
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:10,333
We can say anything we want.

615
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:12,411
How do you make your cigarettes?

616
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:14,742
I don't know.

617
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:17,042
Shame on you.

618
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,948
We breed insect-repellent tobacco seeds,

619
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,748
plant them in the North Carolina sunshine,

620
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:25,187
grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it...

621
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,553
There you go.

622
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:27,819
There you go.

623
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,066
But everybody else's tobacco is toasted.

624
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:42,232
No. Everybody else's
tobacco is poisonous.

625
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:43,968
Lucky Strikes...

626
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:45,476
is toasted.

627
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,515
Well, gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell you
what you just witnessed here.

628
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,143
I think you do.

629
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:59,146
Advertising is based on one thing:

630
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:01,089
Happiness.

631
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:03,389
And you know what happiness is?

632
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:06,465
Happiness is the smell of a new car.

633
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,926
It's freedom from fear.

634
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:14,632
It's a billboard on the side of the road
that screams with reassurance

635
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,733
that whatever you're doing... it's okay.

636
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,782
You are okay.

637
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,651
It's toasted.

638
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,586
I get it.

639
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,066
You had me worried.

640
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,612
I don't know if you were drunk or not drunk,

641
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:55,044
but that was inspired.

642
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:57,776
For the record, I pulled it out of thin air,

643
00:32:57,884 --> 00:32:59,579
so thank you, up there.

644
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:01,448
You're looking in the wrong direction.

645
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,250
So now that I've got you
in the afterglow here,

646
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,622
what do you say you reconsider this
presidential campaign?

647
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:10,093
I don't know. Bunting and babies?

648
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,663
That's hard work.

649
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,231
I'd only make hash of it.

650
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,562
Modesty. That's adorable.

651
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:18,330
Consider the product:
He's young, handsome, Navy hero.

652
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:19,734
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult

653
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,670
to convince America Dick Nixon is a winner.

654
00:33:21,774 --> 00:33:23,901
<i>Mr. Draper, you've got visitors.</i>

655
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:27,673
Could you be a little
more specific, honey?

656
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:30,779
We heard you saved the day.

657
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,512
Oh, thank you, boys. I appreciate it.

658
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,917
I told them how amazing you were.

659
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:37,614
I'm still tingling.

660
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:40,317
Well, looks like you're all going to engage
in a little mid-level camaraderie,

661
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:41,586
so I'll be on my way.

662
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,025
Don, thanks again for the home run.

663
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,994
- I love to come through.
- Speaking of which,

664
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:47,292
any chance you could
patch things up with Rachel Menken?

665
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,459
Any way you can be
as charming as I said you were?

666
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,799
Haven't you had enough
of my magic for one day?

667
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,372
She's worth $3 million.

668
00:33:54,473 --> 00:33:55,963
You're a whore.

669
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,177
Peggy...

670
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,213
Could she get us a little more ice?

671
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:04,749
<i>- Yes, Mr. Draper?
- Just a minute.</i>

672
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,875
Fellas, I think this party's gonna
have to move elsewhere.

673
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:09,284
We'll move wherever you want, but it's 5:15.

674
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:10,685
The bachelor party's underway.

675
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,916
I don't know.

676
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,254
Oh, come on, Don. All hands on deck.

677
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,021
Aren't you gonna help
give Pete his big sendoff?

678
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,891
Maybe next time.

679
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,632
Come on, guys.

680
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:23,258
Don will join us later, right, Don?

681
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:33,209
If Greta's research was any good,

682
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:34,438
I would have used it.

683
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:37,576
What are you talking about?

684
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:39,742
I'm saying I had a report just like that.

685
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:42,446
And it's not like there's
some magic machine

686
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:44,921
that makes identical copies of things.

687
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:48,318
I still think she was right.

688
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,799
Have a great night, Pete.

689
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:56,868
Congratulations.

690
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,273
I heard you were
amazing in the meeting.

691
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:11,976
Fear stimulates my imagination.

692
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,748
I just wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

693
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:20,519
and for, you know...

694
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:23,789
standing up for me with Mr. Campbell.

695
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,034
First of all, Peggy,

696
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:41,545
I'm your boss, not your boyfriend.

697
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:46,443
Second of all, you ever let Pete Campbell
go through my trash again,

698
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:49,487
and you won't be able to find a job
selling sandwiches in Penn Station.

699
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:55,154
He said he left his fountain pen in here.

700
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:56,956
I didn't know.

701
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,464
I hope you don't think
I'm that kind of girl.

702
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:06,436
Of course not.

703
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,837
Go home. Put your curlers in.

704
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,932
We'll get a fresh start tomorrow.

705
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,840
Oh. And, Peggy,

706
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:16,346
I need you to place a call.

707
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,104
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,

708
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:42,265
whether you have drinks or not.

709
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,433
Uh, every five minutes.

710
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,606
Let's live here.

711
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:49,146
Better do more than look tonight.

712
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,738
Do you have a girlfriend, Salvatore?

713
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,717
Come on. I'm Italian.

714
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:55,684
Is there some kind of party here?

715
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:58,914
How did you swing it?

716
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:00,958
They work at the Automat.

717
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,790
He pressed a button, and they came out.

718
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:05,557
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

719
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,063
Definitely not.

720
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,327
Well, I have the best seat.
What are we drinking?

721
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,630
More of whatever's
making you the way you are.

722
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:13,227
I love this place.

723
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:16,240
It's hot, loud, and filled with men.

724
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,003
I know what you mean.

725
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:32,486
Oh, my God. I can already feel it.

726
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:35,116
I have a feeling you're like this all the time.

727
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:36,660
I like to laugh.

728
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:38,093
Is that right?

729
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:40,256
Now, you stop that.

730
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,731
You said you like to laugh.

731
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,495
I mean it.

732
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,126
It's... It's too...

733
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,932
Too delicious.

734
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,473
Hey, I said stop it.
What do you think you're doing?

735
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:51,270
You know exactly.

736
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:52,969
Um, you know what, girls?

737
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,204
I think we should go.

738
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,371
Oh, come on.

739
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,142
You're hurting me.

740
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,543
I'll be good.

741
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:05,090
Buy the girls whatever they want.

742
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:13,762
So, uh, what do you fellas do?

743
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:16,460
You're looking at the finest
ad men in New York.

744
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,469
Hell, the world.

745
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:46,192
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,

746
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:48,027
and one whiskey neat.

747
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:54,765
So...

748
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,842
you're going to ply me with drinks

749
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:59,376
and convince me what a terrible
mistake I'm making.

750
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,069
That is quite a drink.

751
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:05,207
You got in trouble, didn't you?

752
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:09,518
I shouldn't have lost my temper,

753
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,590
and I certainly
shouldn't have treated you

754
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,884
like anything less than a client.

755
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,926
Apology accepted.

756
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:18,630
So you understand.

757
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,528
Now I do.

758
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:24,501
It was, uh, refreshing, really.

759
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:29,040
I mean, actually hearing all the things
I always assumed people were thinking.

760
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:33,470
Well, I'm not really as bad as all that.

761
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,843
I was under a lot of pressure.

762
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:39,247
Another account.

763
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:43,716
Doesn't really matter.

764
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:45,881
No, it doesn't.

765
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:53,723
So, without making things worse,
can I ask you a personal question?

766
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:57,268
Don't you want to get
a second drink in me first?

767
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,666
Why aren't you married?

768
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:02,538
Are you asking
what's wrong with me?

769
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,802
It's just that you're
a beautiful, educated woman.

770
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,037
Don't you think that getting married
and having a family

771
00:40:07,146 --> 00:40:08,738
would make you happier
than all the headaches

772
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:10,280
that go along with...

773
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:11,906
fighting people like me?

774
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,887
If I weren't a woman,
I would be allowed

775
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:19,583
to ask you the same question.

776
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,057
And if I weren't a woman,

777
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,687
I wouldn't have to choose
between putting on an apron

778
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,790
and the thrill of making my father's store
what I always thought it should be.

779
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:34,999
So that's it. You won't get married
because you find business to be a thrill.

780
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:37,405
That and...

781
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:42,607
I've never been in love.

782
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:46,173
She won't get married
because she's never been in love.

783
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:48,947
I think I wrote that once to sell nylons.

784
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:53,150
For a lot of people,
love isn't just a slogan.

785
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,520
Oh, you mean love.

786
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:56,151
You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart

787
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,286
where you can't eat and you can't work

788
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:04,666
and you just run off
and get married and make babies.

789
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,706
The reason you haven't felt it
is because it doesn't exist.

790
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,069
What you call love

791
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:14,168
was invented by guys
like me to sell nylons.

792
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:17,312
Is that right?

793
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,077
I'm pretty sure about it.

794
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:22,310
You're born alone,
and you die alone,

795
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:24,753
and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on you

796
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,085
to make you forget those facts,

797
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:27,715
but I never forget.

798
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,493
I'm living like there's no tomorrow...

799
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:34,657
because there isn't one.

800
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,637
I don't think I realized it until this moment,

801
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:45,666
but it must be hard being a man, too.

802
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:48,140
Excuse me?

803
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:50,914
Mr. Draper...

804
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:52,347
- Don.
- Mr. Draper,

805
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:55,784
I don't know what it is
you really believe in,

806
00:41:55,888 --> 00:42:02,885
but I do know what it feels like
to be out of place, to be disconnected,

807
00:42:02,995 --> 00:42:05,691
to see the whole world
laid out in front of you

808
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:08,164
the way other people live it.

809
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:13,398
There is something about you
that tells me you know it, too.

810
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,905
I don't know if that's true.

811
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,278
You want another drink?

812
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,443
No.

813
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:30,954
But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.

814
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:39,827
So I guess we'll be
seeing each other again.

815
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:45,063
I'll be back in the office Monday morning,
for a real meeting.

816
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,138
I'd like that.

817
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,617
We're not buying anything.

818
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,884
Actually, for the first time today,

819
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:09,119
I'm not selling anything.

820
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:11,389
Does Peggy live here?

821
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:12,486
Hold on.

822
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,341
Do you know him?

823
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:30,139
It's okay, Marjorie.
We work together.

824
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:32,906
He's really drunk.

825
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:35,077
It's okay, Marjorie.

826
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:41,685
So... what are you doing?

827
00:43:41,794 --> 00:43:42,852
Nothing.

828
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:46,226
Just, uh, sitting in my room
listening to records.

829
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,265
I'm getting married on Sunday.

830
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:50,392
I heard that.

831
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,931
You must think I'm a creep.

832
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,535
Why are you here?

833
00:44:09,054 --> 00:44:11,750
I wanted to see you tonight.

834
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,491
Me?

835
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:19,962
I had to see you.

836
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,906
Marjorie?

837
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:33,068
Yeah, Peg?

838
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:35,146
I'm going to bed now.

839
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:04,800
I called the office. They said you'd left.

840
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,630
I didn't want to bother you.

841
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:11,504
It's no bother.

842
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,909
I just assumed you were staying
in the city again.

843
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,447
There's a plate in the oven.

844
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,524
Unless you're not hungry.

845
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:28,923
I'm not.

846
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:34,957
I'll be right back.

847
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:37,228
Don't move.
