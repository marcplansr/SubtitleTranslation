1
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,237
Should get him to put
another egg in it.

2
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,335
Roger.

3
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:58,313
Darling, one egg is good.
Two eggs are better.

4
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,484
Tell the, uh, lieutenant, please,

5
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:04,612
that things are getting a little dry
around Hill 29.

6
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:05,620
Am I wrong?

7
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:07,247
All clear in No Man's Land.

8
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,256
Betty?

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,055
Roger, you've expressed
your desire for another drink.

10
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:12,629
No need to take the orders.

11
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,754
Right away, sir.

12
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,763
Wine list,

13
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,597
and I'll have another one of these
while I'm waiting for the list.

14
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,193
Another egg.

15
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:21,863
Well, I am having fried chicken.

16
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:23,770
As long as the egg comes first.

17
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,275
My nanny, Belva, made fried chicken.

18
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,937
I used to take it to school
wrapped in wax paper.

19
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,605
His sweet Belvedere.

20
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,012
He really loved that woman.

21
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:34,108
Had another nanny
originally. German girl.

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,915
Round face, enormous bosom.

23
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,581
My parents got rid of her
after the Lindbergh baby.

24
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,249
We thought about getting a nanny.

25
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,054
We have a girl that comes in

26
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:46,289
who's sort of a housekeeper
and sometimes babysitter.

27
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:50,458
I'd let her take the children to play group,
sometimes the park.

28
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,626
Belva raised me.

29
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,998
I turned out just fine.

30
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:55,834
Didn't have to go to a psychiatrist
like some people's kids.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,532
Oh, what's the big deal?

32
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:00,702
Margaret is practically the last girl
in our building to go.

33
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:03,110
16 years old, wouldn't get out of bed.

34
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:07,082
I tell you, I cannot wait until that girl
is another man's problem.

35
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:08,277
What about you, Don?

36
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:10,718
Did you have a nanny?

37
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,517
I can't tell you about my childhood.

38
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:14,615
It would ruin the first half of my novel.

39
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,785
Don doesn't like to talk about himself.

40
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:18,362
I know better than to ask.

41
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,488
An ad man who doesn't like
to talk about himself?

42
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,963
I think I may cry.

43
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,762
It's not that interesting a story.

44
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:27,963
Just think of me as Moses.

45
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:29,903
I was a baby in a basket.

46
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:34,138
To Moses and Don Draper:
A couple of princes.

47
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:39,673
If the gentlemen will be patient.

48
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,149
I'll join you.

49
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,425
I think I may know more about your wife
than I do about my own.

50
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,295
Maybe your wife is just a better drinker.

51
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,096
Entirely possible.

52
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,111
Mona, could you help me here?

53
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,450
I seem to have grown a set of thumbs.

54
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:20,524
Do you ever have that
when your hands go numb?

55
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,553
You want me to touch you up?

56
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,994
Yeah, I think you'll have to.

57
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,230
Look at those lips.

58
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,534
I'll bet it's not hard for you
to hold on to a man like that.

59
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,107
Don't smile. It'll make it harder.

60
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:44,809
It's hard to hold on to anything
right now with the... children

61
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,679
and running the house and...

62
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:47,944
I don't know if I told you,

63
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:51,488
but my m-mother died two, three months ago.

64
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,452
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:58,017
There are other ladies
waiting to use the mirror.

66
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:09,002
Those purses get any smaller,
we're gonna starve.

67
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,946
I love seeing you like that.

68
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,018
Well, you were sitting on my good side.

69
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,920
No. I mean, the way
other people see you.

70
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,618
When you're with strangers,
you know exactly what you want.

71
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,287
Well, I like to think
I always know what I want.

72
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,127
Slow down.

73
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,201
I'll have to put that in my diary:

74
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:40,271
Lobster Newburg and gimlets
should get a divorce.

75
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:42,771
They're not getting along very well.

76
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,569
Once you rounded the corner
on number two,

77
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,473
I took it for a case of nerves.

78
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,512
He's your boss.

79
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,048
He likes you.

80
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,586
Toots Shor means he likes me.

81
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,518
When he gets us to the Four Seasons,

82
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,715
then we'll know he trusts me.

83
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:02,691
Hmm. He seemed very forthcoming.

84
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,820
Yeah. When he's stoned on martinis.

85
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,125
I don't know.

86
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,291
It all seemed like an invitation to you

87
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:13,859
to con... confide.

88
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:16,303
Well, maybe it's just manners,

89
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,774
but I was raised to see it
as a sin of pride

90
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,402
to go on like that about yourself.

91
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,504
You're so reverent.

92
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:40,156
Did you have a nanny?

93
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:41,754
I've never asked you that.

94
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:45,199
Why? What difference does it make?

95
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,828
I don't know.
We've never talked about it.

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,468
Did you?

97
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,701
No, of course not.

98
00:05:56,247 --> 00:06:00,946
So your mother and father
are responsible for all this?

99
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:03,418
I'll have to thank them someday.

100
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,352
Jesus, Bets.

101
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:10,553
It's like politics, religion, or sex.

102
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,458
Why talk about it?

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,592
I see your point.

104
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,090
Who is in there?

105
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:59,368
Peggy, next step is accessories.

106
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:03,607
$35 a week, minus 6.75 for FICA.

107
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,874
Can you believe it?

108
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:08,008
Maybe it's the fumes
from the rubber cement on that envelope,

109
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,087
but there's nothing to be happy about here,

110
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,952
although you never forget your first.

111
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,458
For two weeks I've been telling people
I have a job in Manhattan.

112
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,155
Look at you. You're indomitable.

113
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:22,061
You'd never know you were the very bottom
of the food chain.

114
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:26,861
Bridget? Are you okay?

115
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:34,275
Thanks to the Precision Valve Corporation,

116
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:35,572
for the next 18 months,

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,446
Gillette is the only company on Earth
that can spray deodorant out of a can.

118
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,644
Modern deodorant for a modern man.

119
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,085
He prefers jet travel to train travel,

120
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,781
vodka to Scotch,

121
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,985
and he likes to get his news
from the radio, not the paper.

122
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,152
Harold Hill, give it a rest.

123
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,355
"Do not puncture or incinerate. "

124
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:54,726
Sounds dangerous.

125
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,732
Hey, I got a dud.

126
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,804
How is it a guy as big as you, Ken,

127
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,739
has no basketball skills?

128
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:08,607
I'm sure more research is needed.

129
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,872
We should try it out.

130
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,678
Who smells bad in here?

131
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,650
Oh, no. Come on.

132
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,381
- Come on, Kenny.
- Knock it off!

133
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:19,979
Just pretend it's prom night.

134
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,217
You can be the girl.

135
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,223
Stop!

136
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:23,258
Engage rockets.

137
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,259
All right, close your eyes.

138
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,589
Mr. Draper, I was buzzing you.

139
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,429
Mr. Cooper is waiting.

140
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:34,699
I always thought it was Sterling

141
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,797
who was responsible
for the Navy attitude around this place.

142
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,933
Brassiere account.

143
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:42,035
Just figured out
we can't sell them to men.

144
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,912
So much yarn, so little time.

145
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:54,290
So Roger mentioned this Nixon thing.

146
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:55,654
Yeah, he mentioned it.

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,125
I just assumed it went away.

148
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:58,991
It didn't.

149
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:01,530
Last I read, Nixon was
running without an agency.

150
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,293
Make no mistake, we know better

151
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:06,802
what Dick Nixon needs
better than Dick Nixon.

152
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,428
What does Dick Nixon think he needs?

153
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,803
What he already has: Ted Rogers,

154
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:13,240
the brains behind that Checkers broadcast.

155
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,470
See the problem?

156
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,171
He dodged a financial scandal

157
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,646
by standing with his wife
and begging for his dog.

158
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,046
An admission wrapped in a distraction.

159
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,311
I'd say they know what they're doing.

160
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,511
Dogs are winners.

161
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,746
Well, they think they're set without us.

162
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,515
Why chase a girl who doesn't
want to get caught?

163
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,147
You have a problem with Nixon?

164
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,384
I don't vote.

165
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:30,790
Hear, hear.

166
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,021
But politics aside,

167
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,824
these last eight years have been good to us

168
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,899
because they've been good
to Proctor & Gamble

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,764
and The United Fruit Company,
et cetera.

170
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,268
So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not...

171
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,705
We will give our people
what they want, agreed?

172
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,572
I said cut it out!

173
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,735
Be my pleasure.

174
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,437
Goodie.

175
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:52,981
Assemble a team.

176
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,483
Start files on contenders:

177
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:55,643
Symington, Kennedy...

178
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:59,621
Who knows? Maybe Eleanor Roosevelt
will throw her feedbag into the ring.

179
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,055
Don, you still on for lunch?

180
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:03,093
No.

181
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,397
Don't tell me that's lunch.

182
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,435
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

183
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:13,560
I do that sometimes.

184
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:15,434
Saunter over to the pie cart.

185
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,507
Egg salad and the worst
cup of coffee in the world.

186
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:18,506
35 cents.

187
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,474
I've been meaning to try it.

188
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,274
It's okay if you like ptomaine poisoning.

189
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,678
Well, toodle-oo.

190
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,312
Secretary 1, copywriter 0.

191
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,390
It wasn't that.

192
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:36,483
I bring my lunch at least until after
the first of the month.

193
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,152
Get your things.

194
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,992
That sandwich is making me sad.

195
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:47,301
It's a postcard from Campbell
on his honeymoon.

196
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:48,838
Niagara Falls.

197
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,635
"Greetings from the wettest place on earth. "

198
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,742
I say we skip lunch altogether

199
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,871
and try on those narrow sweater sets
I saw at Lord and Taylor.

200
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:59,711
Do you want me to sit
outside the dressing room

201
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,375
and hold your purse?

202
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,010
What he's trying to say is
can we buy you lunch?

203
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,089
Oh. I don't know.

204
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,555
We hadn't planned on eating.

205
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:08,682
Come on, three on two.

206
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,987
I know you all like being outnumbered.

207
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,561
That's two on two. I'm married.

208
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,563
You still have to eat lunch.

209
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:16,724
What do you say? Change of plans?

210
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,233
They do smell nice.

211
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:20,401
What's that?

212
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:22,199
Postcard from Pete Campbell.

213
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,705
He's on a honeymoon, right?

214
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,797
Niagara Falls.

215
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,241
He hasn't, uh, left the room, apparently.

216
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,018
Shall we?

217
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:45,553
So, Pegs, you part of our nation's
military industrial

218
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,756
boyfriend-girlfriend complex?

219
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:48,854
Excuse me?

220
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:52,402
He wants to know are you, uh, taken,
are you kept, or merely browsing?

221
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,561
She's browsing.

222
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,899
And like most of us,

223
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,439
she's disappointed
with the selection of merchandise.

224
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:00,802
Perhaps I can interest you in a 42 long?

225
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,037
That's not his suit size.

226
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,048
She blushes.

227
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:06,173
No, I don't.

228
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:10,811
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but, uh,
you are the subject of much debate.

229
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,013
Money riding on the outcome.

230
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:13,181
Money for me?

231
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,383
Now there's even a third possibility:

232
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:16,653
Paying you.

233
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:19,995
We should be getting back.

234
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,257
I'll get the check.

235
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,390
My goodness.
Thank you for lunch, boys.

236
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,435
Yes. Thank you.

237
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,573
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

238
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:35,236
We could... go to the zoo,
see what the animals are up to.

239
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,975
I should get back to work.

240
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,550
Or shopping.

241
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,549
Guess I don't see any money
changing hands, Kenny.

242
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:45,553
You'll see.

243
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,022
My persistence is my charm.

244
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,558
That was delicious.

245
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,095
You enjoy yourself with the Hitler Youth?

246
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,294
Oh. Well, it was kind of last-minute.

247
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,837
Easy. See that Draper takes a look at this.

248
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:03,201
Certainly.

249
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,870
You can look, too.

250
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,279
Three of the last PTA presidents
are from the kindergarten class.

251
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,354
I say you go in there
and lay some groundwork.

252
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:20,480
I will not have Marilyn Kechner
dictate the agenda.

253
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,786
The woman is obsessed with nutrition,

254
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,554
although you wouldn't
know it to look at her.

255
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:27,028
Francine, you're terrible.

256
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,157
Ooh. I ran into Juanita Cabot
at square dancing,

257
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,168
and I found out who's moving
into that little Dutch Colonial down the street.

258
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,396
Who?

259
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,666
Her name is Helen Bishop.

260
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,241
Is she an old lady?

261
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:39,639
Divorced.

262
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:42,041
Really?

263
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,637
9- year-old boy and a baby.

264
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:46,581
That's awful.

265
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:47,582
I know.

266
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:48,709
All on her own?

267
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,912
I know.

268
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:55,515
Can you imagine worrying about money
at this point in our lives?

269
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,526
Well, obviously,
that's not the worst of it.

270
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,960
No.

271
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,725
No, it isn't.

272
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,062
It is too quiet in there.

273
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:05,066
Ernie?

274
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,067
Sally?

275
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,229
We're playing spaceman.

276
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,238
Sally Draper, come over here this minute.

277
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:18,476
If the clothes from that dry cleaning bag
are on the floor of my closet,

278
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,709
you're going to be
a very sorry young lady.

279
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:26,087
Make sure your brother hasn't climbed
out of the play yard.

280
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,387
Juanita thinks it might be bad
for real estate values in Chilmark.

281
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,051
One divorcée?

282
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,454
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,682
Are you okay?

284
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,551
What's that?

285
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:09,591
What?

286
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,354
That.

287
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:13,828
That's a television.

288
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,523
Since when do you have a television?

289
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:19,625
I don't know. I think it's been about ten days.

290
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:22,399
It's been so amazing, I sort of lost track.

291
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:23,973
I seem to remember a woman

292
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:26,338
wasting a good piece
of a beautiful afternoon

293
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,343
reciting this diatribe against television

294
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,176
that should have ended
with her banging her shoe on the table.

295
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:37,748
Don, darling, if you want
to ask the question, just ask it.

296
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,322
Where'd you get the TV?

297
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,687
I got it.

298
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,282
Same place you got that wig?

299
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:45,259
Someone gave it to me.

300
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:48,758
And you took it?

301
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:51,562
<i>Have you seen this thing
called People Are Funny?</i>

302
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,006
Jesus.

303
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:57,767
Oh, Jesus, Don.

304
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:05,871
Hey!

305
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,245
All better?

306
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:10,784
Yes.

307
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,590
How about a hot dog?

308
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,264
Sit at your places. Come on.

309
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,648
Daddy!

310
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,048
We went to the hospital.

311
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:43,983
We got lollipops.

312
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,325
They're fine, Don.

313
00:17:52,296 --> 00:17:53,263
What about you?

314
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,196
A little sore.

315
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,665
A little embarrassed.

316
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:59,895
Sorry they couldn't get a hold of me.

317
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:03,166
We had to carry Freddie Rumson
out of Ritazzi's.

318
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,173
There was nothing you could have done.

319
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,706
Daddy, use a fork.

320
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:15,885
How's the car?

321
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,112
Not bad.

322
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,452
Uh, thank God
I was only going 25 tops.

323
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,956
I hate the way you drive, you know.

324
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,856
I'm finished.

325
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,895
<i>Can I go watch
Shirley Temple's Storybook?</i>

326
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:27,486
Yes, both of you.

327
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,471
So what happened?

328
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,701
I don't know, really.

329
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,541
It... It all happened so fast.

330
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,711
What, 20 miles an hour?

331
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:48,444
That's not that fast.

332
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,578
It's stupid.

333
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:53,383
Was it Sally playing with the radio again?

334
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,821
- I've warned her.
- No, she was fine.

335
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,291
She was just sitting there. No.

336
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:02,056
It was my hands. It happened again.

337
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,265
Jesus.

338
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:11,470
Betty, you have to get this taken care of.

339
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:14,043
That Dr. Patterson is not thorough.

340
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:15,702
I swear, when we walked
down Park Avenue,

341
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:16,710
I could hear the quacking.

342
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,110
I know. You've said that.

343
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:20,445
This doctor was nice.

344
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:22,678
He was older, actually.

345
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,276
He's from Rochester.

346
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,356
He has two children.
They're 10 years apart.

347
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,321
Okay, you've given me his credentials.

348
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:30,052
What did he say?

349
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,493
Well, he said I could go to New York
and run the dye tests,

350
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:37,431
and I said that I already had
and that the results were negative,

351
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,399
and he even called Dr. Patterson.

352
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,834
So?

353
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,845
They said there was
nothing physically wrong with me.

354
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,538
Then I t-told him what happened,

355
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,276
and he said that I should
see a psychiatrist.

356
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,485
Doctors must love

357
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:03,890
that they now have an answer
for "I don't know what's wrong. "

358
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,552
He said it could be a nervous condition.

359
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,653
Nervous about what, driving?

360
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,561
So we'll go down to the Grand Union
parking lot.

361
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,690
We'll practice your 10 and 2.

362
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,632
He seemed very concerned,
if you want to know.

363
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:14,169
But that's their solution.

364
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:16,637
Why not open the hood
and poke around?

365
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:19,607
So?

366
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,339
So... I left.

367
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:24,744
What else am I supposed to do?

368
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,872
Well, go to a doctor...

369
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,143
another doctor, a good one.

370
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:29,651
I'll get a specialist from Bert Cooper.

371
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:32,051
His name's on a wall
over at St. Vincent's.

372
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:33,486
Okay.

373
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,615
Leave the dishes for the girl.

374
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:44,227
7, 8, 9,

375
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:49,294
10, 11, 12...

376
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:55,367
98, 99, 100.

377
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,919
You know, I do worry about you, birdie.

378
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,519
I know.

379
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,864
When he brought it up, I was shocked.

380
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:26,272
Although, I realize that
that's what Dr. Patterson

381
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:29,539
was trying to say in his own way, and...

382
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:36,341
it doesn't have...
as much of a stigma today.

383
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,282
I just don't know
what they can possibly tell you.

384
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,325
Do you think I need a psychiatrist?

385
00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:00,267
I always thought people saw a psychiatrist
when they were unhappy.

386
00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:03,937
But I look at you...

387
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,840
and this...

388
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:09,944
and them...

389
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:16,315
and that...

390
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,695
and I think, "Are you unhappy?"

391
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:27,833
Of course I'm happy.

392
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:30,873
Well, that'll be $35. You're welcome.

393
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,044
Whatever you think is best.

394
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,112
Good.

395
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:06,672
Act of God. Sorry.

396
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:09,541
Someone threw themselves
in front of the train.

397
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:11,705
Ah, suicide.

398
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:17,114
Okay, boys, what do we have?

399
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:22,688
Gentlemen, the aerosol can
is nothing less than space-age.

400
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,317
It's steel. It has exhaust.

401
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:25,895
It's even shaped like a rocket.

402
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:28,430
Certainly an engineering marvel.

403
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,295
"Right Guard:

404
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,925
It works in my suit or yours. "

405
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,596
We'll punch the yellow of the moon
so it pops behind him.

406
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:42,637
We're looking for new worlds,

407
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:45,180
and with that search
comes any number of gadgets.

408
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:47,250
It's not just some random association.

409
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,818
This thing is shiny. It's explosive.

410
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,548
It's from the future,
a place so close to us now,

411
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:54,487
filled with wonder and ease.

412
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:59,121
Except some people
think of the future and it upsets them.

413
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,557
They see a rocket,
they start building a bomb shelter.

414
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,361
What? How do you get there?

415
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:07,869
I don't think it's ridiculous to assume
we're looking for other planets

416
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:09,962
because this one will end.

417
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,098
I thought we had something here.

418
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,234
Who is this moron flying around space?

419
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,369
I mean, he pees in his pants.

420
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,843
Brass tacks, who buys this?

421
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,079
Some woman.

422
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:27,520
Your girl or your mother will pick this up

423
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:30,422
walking through the grocery store
or the druggist's.

424
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,085
We should be asking ourselves,

425
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:33,457
"What do women want?"

426
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:35,929
I don't know, but I wish I had it.

427
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,395
Maybe a chesty alien girl
also wants to get into his suit.

428
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:41,835
I'm not asking "what do women want"

429
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,202
in some bullshit
research psychology way.

430
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:46,775
I'm asking,
what would make a woman

431
00:24:46,877 --> 00:24:49,505
look at this man's deodorant
and say "I want that"?

432
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,706
Well, I've stopped
trying to figure out what they think.

433
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:53,373
Maybe I should stop paying you.

434
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:00,186
Well, I always thought
women like the way we smell.

435
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,848
That explains a lot.

436
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,425
I feel like we're close here.

437
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:04,824
I mean, this one...

438
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:08,193
the can's right side up,
but the guy's upside-down.

439
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,766
No. Let's bring it down to Earth.

440
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,867
You think they want a cowboy?

441
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,374
He's quiet and strong.

442
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,379
He always brings the cattle home safe.

443
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:29,176
You watch TV.

444
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:33,447
What if they want something else?

445
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,786
Inside, some...

446
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:41,791
mysterious wish that we're ignoring.

447
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,018
How'd it go?

448
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,811
I've still got my novel.

449
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:07,412
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,720
Buy me lunch?

451
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,523
Samuel, that drape, man?

452
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:17,031
It's sadder than a map.

453
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:20,432
Well, it's lightweight,
and it tells me I'm at work.

454
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,505
But you sure can talk, Mr. Kinsey.

455
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,766
60 cents.

456
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,001
What are you doing? Keep the change.

457
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,543
You figured the place out yet?

458
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:31,705
What do you mean?

459
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:32,873
How it runs.

460
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:35,611
I know the copywriters
tell the Art Department what to do,

461
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,483
and I know the account executives
tell the copywriters what to do.

462
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:39,850
What?

463
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,686
No one tells the writers what to do
except for the head of Creative,

464
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,352
your boss, Donald Draper.

465
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:48,659
Don't think that just because
he's good-looking, he's not a writer.

466
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:49,697
Dig.

467
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,528
This is the Media Department.

468
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:53,626
They're where 90% of where
the client's check goes.

469
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,535
They buy space... newspapers,
billboards, television,

470
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,609
and my favorite aging whore, radio.

471
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:02,769
That's the whole shakedown, actually.

472
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:04,369
All you really need to know.

473
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:07,041
They don't sell ideas
or campaigns or jingles.

474
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,550
They sell media at a 15% markup.

475
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:10,881
Creative is just window dressing

476
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:11,885
that's thrown in for free.

477
00:27:11,988 --> 00:27:13,216
Really?

478
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,257
Accounting, they keep track
of how much we're spending

479
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:16,450
versus how much we're taking in,

480
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,151
and since we're buying futures,

481
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:22,960
if you ever, ever see, um,
the man upstairs go in there,

482
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,363
grab the lifeboats, baby.

483
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,230
We're going down.

484
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:30,169
Account Management,

485
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:34,369
<i>where prep schoolers skip arm-in-arm,
Wizard of Oz style,</i>

486
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:38,504
joined together by their lack of skill
and their love of mirrors.

487
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:41,651
Account executives
are all good at something,

488
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:45,517
although it's never advertising.

489
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,854
Submitted for your approval:
One Peter Campbell,

490
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,517
a man who recently discovered

491
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,587
that the only place for his hand
is in your pocket.

492
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,690
You watch it?

493
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,666
<i>Have you seen it? The Twilight Zone?</i>

494
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:02,863
I don't think so.
I don't like science fiction.

495
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,167
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

496
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,505
Mitch in Media says
CBS might pull the plug.

497
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,043
I'll kill myself.

498
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,212
And here we have
the Creative Department,

499
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,220
the talent, home sweet home.

500
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,256
Like the Art Department downstairs,

501
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:23,621
they put us far enough
away from the elevators

502
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:25,524
so we can't sneak out.

503
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,568
You know,

504
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,536
there are women copywriters.

505
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:37,299
- Good ones?
- Sure.

506
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:40,240
I mean, y-you can always tell
when a woman's writing copy,

507
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,904
but sometimes she just might be
the right man for the job, you know?

508
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:48,183
You must be very creatively satisfied.

509
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:50,752
Let's not lose our heads.

510
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,880
Sterling-Coop is positively Cro-Magnon.

511
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,049
I have a friend... I'm not even going
to say what agency...

512
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,423
but all they do is smoke Mary Jane
and play darts,

513
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,053
and honestly, I think
they're the best store on the street.

514
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,791
You like Ukrainian food?

515
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:08,063
Oxtail dumplings?

516
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:10,230
I still have a lot of work to do.

517
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,830
I think he's still in there.

518
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,135
Huh. Got it.

519
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:17,378
Thanks for lunch.
Sorry about your copy.

520
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,448
Thanks for reminding me.

521
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,165
Can never get used
to the fact that most of the time

522
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,669
it looks like you're doing nothing.

523
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,004
Fix you something?

524
00:29:45,108 --> 00:29:48,009
4:30. Close enough.

525
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:49,203
Coop is gonna want a carve-in

526
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:51,303
with your handpicked team for Nixon on it,

527
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:55,612
and I warn you right now,
it includes Pete Campbell.

528
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,345
I should go to Niagara Falls for two weeks.

529
00:29:57,453 --> 00:29:58,920
Does wonders for your career.

530
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,751
Niagara Falls.

531
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:03,382
Boy redefines lack of imagination.

532
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:08,862
Ah. That's where you've been.

533
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:12,492
Let me ask you something.

534
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,830
What do women want?

535
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,962
Who cares?

536
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:18,868
You mentioned the other night

537
00:30:18,975 --> 00:30:22,502
that your daughter
had been to a psychiatrist.

538
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:26,675
I'm sure you must be mistaken about that.

539
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,253
You know what?

540
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:35,154
I am very comfortable with my mind:
Thoughts clean and unclean,

541
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:38,022
loving and... the opposite of that.

542
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,153
But I'm not a woman.

543
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:42,788
And I think it behooves any man

544
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,892
to toss all female troubles
into the hands of a stranger.

545
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:48,630
We had one headshrinker in the army.

546
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:52,071
A gossip, busting
with other people's thoughts.

547
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:54,040
Hasn't changed much, just costs more.

548
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,667
And you can't shoot at them.

549
00:30:55,778 --> 00:30:57,006
We live in troubling times.

550
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:58,410
We do?

551
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:02,780
Who could not be happy with all this?

552
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,217
Jesus, you know what they want?

553
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
Everything.

554
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:08,318
Especially if the other girls have it.

555
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:13,088
Trust me, psychiatry is just
this year's candy-pink stove.

556
00:31:18,134 --> 00:31:20,261
It's just more happiness.

557
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:29,643
<i>People...</i>

558
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,778
<i>Are...</i>

559
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,713
<i>Funnyl</i>

560
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,976
Beauty and the beast.

561
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,281
Hey, Daddy.

562
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:42,790
Hey, there. Cold lamb sound good?

563
00:31:42,892 --> 00:31:44,359
Yeah.

564
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:51,828
Someone started on the train.

565
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:53,095
In the office.

566
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,069
Because of a good day or a bad day?

567
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:01,235
You know, when I told you
you had everything...

568
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,744
I was wrong.

569
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,347
Oh, my God.

570
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,679
White gold.

571
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:18,454
It's got one of those tiny little faces
that you have to be young to see.

572
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,426
Don, it's beautiful.

573
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:25,625
The guy at the store set the time,
but he was English,

574
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,794
so it might be six hours off.

575
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,600
Did you look at Sally's face?

576
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,004
I think she has a bruise.

577
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:33,268
I didn't see it.

578
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:35,537
On her cheekbone under her eye.

579
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:37,044
I thought that was ketchup.

580
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:41,139
What if she had gotten a scar,
something permanent?

581
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,047
I don't want to play what-if.

582
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:45,712
I'm just saying if it happened to Bobby
it would have been okay

583
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:49,485
because a boy with a scar is nothing,
but a girl, it's so much worse.

584
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,650
Nothing happened.

585
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,694
I keep...

586
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:53,853
thinking...

587
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:58,763
Not that I c-could have killed the kids,

588
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:04,135
but... worse.

589
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,869
Sally could have survived...

590
00:33:07,977 --> 00:33:10,275
and gone on living with this...

591
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,544
horrible scar on her face, and...

592
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,053
some long, lonely...

593
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,023
miserable life as...

594
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:26,718
Don.

595
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:38,973
What's happening to me?

596
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,408
Do I need to see someone?

597
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:53,352
I don't know.

598
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:56,756
I guess so.

599
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,019
Whatever you want.

600
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:14,638
11 a. m. Did you get fired?

601
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,304
Brought Betty into the city to see the doctor,

602
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:21,645
but, uh, honestly...

603
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:25,517
I think I'm the one that's not feeling so great.

604
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:27,782
I called in sick.

605
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,586
Don't bring that here.

606
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,491
I'm serious, Don.
Don't talk to me about her.

607
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:36,789
It makes me feel cruel.

608
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:46,005
You're right.

609
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:48,940
Sometimes.

610
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,414
I can't decide

611
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:56,610
if you have everything...

612
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,448
or nothing.

613
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,488
I live in the moment.

614
00:35:06,162 --> 00:35:08,255
Nothing is everything.

615
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,633
Sounds more like you live in the Village.

616
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,101
Actually, I live in the hall.

617
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:16,671
I lost my key.

618
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:20,071
I had to, um...
spend the night abroad.

619
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:21,803
Could you be a gentleman

620
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,937
and break in to the fire escape
so I don't have to?

621
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:35,989
Draper in yet?

622
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,151
He's not coming in today.
He's not feeling well.

623
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,957
I'm leaving. Don't tell anyone I was here.

624
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:50,763
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

625
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:54,241
No, it's Peggy.

626
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:56,569
Hello.

627
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:01,144
I don't think I can go out to lunch today.

628
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,649
Mr. Draper's not coming in.

629
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:05,084
That means you can go out to lunch.

630
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,088
Have you never worked
in an office before?

631
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,919
Well, he could call.

632
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,014
It's my second week.

633
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,593
Another time?

634
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,719
I did enjoy the tour the other day.

635
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:15,057
It was eye-opening.

636
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:18,133
I didn't think your eyes
could be any wider.

637
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,633
That's clever.

638
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:26,634
I guess I'll go to the cart.
You want something?

639
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:30,312
What?

640
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:33,538
The office is gonna
empty out any second.

641
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,412
We can push the couch
in front of the door.

642
00:36:35,518 --> 00:36:37,543
Paul.

643
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,918
Do you belong to someone else?

644
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:43,583
Shit.

645
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:45,661
I don't even like to sit in Don's chair.

646
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:47,786
I think we've
misunderstood each other.

647
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:54,567
But there is someone else, right?

648
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,728
Yes.

649
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,656
I hope you know that covering
your typewriter

650
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:21,161
is office code for "I'm done for the day. "

651
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:22,595
I'm not feeling so swell.

652
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,156
Neither am I. Look at these letters
you typed after lunch.

653
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:31,536
Terre Haute, Indiana,
has two Rs and an A and an E at the end.

654
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,370
I think either you missed
home row by a hand,

655
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:35,706
or you were out drinking
with the junior account boys again.

656
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:36,709
I wasn't drinking.

657
00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:38,541
I don't like your tone.

658
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:42,016
I'll redo these right away.

659
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:44,382
Look at you, all in a snit.

660
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:47,415
Are you gonna watch me?

661
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:48,751
What is wrong with you?

662
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,119
Honestly, why is it that every time

663
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,254
a man takes you
out to lunch around here,

664
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:57,195
you're... you're the dessert?

665
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,426
That's terrible.

666
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,434
It's constant from every corner.

667
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:03,061
I'm from Bay Ridge. We have manners.

668
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:04,799
Why can't they just leave it alone?

669
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,171
Because men always
bother you all the time.

670
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:09,676
They follow you down the street.

671
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:11,303
Well, not exactly.

672
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,110
Look, dear, I don't know you that well,

673
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:15,979
but you're the new girl,
and you're not much,

674
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,383
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

675
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,387
Of course.

676
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:21,717
Don't be that way.

677
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:23,792
I'm just offering some perspective, that's all.

678
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:27,222
Thank you, Joan.

679
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,729
I'll save my thank-yous

680
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:30,662
till you correct that correspondence.

681
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,611
I don't know why I'm here.

682
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm... I mean, I do.

683
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:03,456
I'm... nervous, I guess.

684
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,390
Anxious.

685
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:08,926
I don't sleep that well.

686
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,625
And my hands...

687
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,565
Well, they're fine now.

688
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,775
It's like when you have
a problem with your car

689
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,335
and you go to the mechanic
and it's not doing it anymore.

690
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,809
Not that you are a mechanic.

691
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:40,020
I guess a lot of people must come here
worried about the bomb.

692
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:41,494
Is that true?

693
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:47,735
It's a common nightmare, people say.

694
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:49,805
I read it in a magazine.

695
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,515
My mother always told me
that it wasn't polite to talk about yourself.

696
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:09,183
She passed away recently.

697
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:14,387
I guess I already said that.

698
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:20,828
Can I smoke in here?

699
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:50,095
We're all so lucky to be here.

700
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:54,594
It's 7:30.

701
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:56,568
I have to go to Roy's reading.

702
00:41:56,672 --> 00:42:00,608
I have to be there to act surprised
when Jack Kerouac doesn't show.

703
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,743
Lock the door when you leave.

704
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,781
If you're gonna go home,
take a shower.

705
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,255
You stink.

706
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,553
It's because I'm a man.

707
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,686
You seem to forget that sometimes.

708
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:22,229
I'm lucky they aren't all like you.

709
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,958
I'll take that as a compliment.

710
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:30,369
What do women want?

711
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:33,908
Well, one of the things has to be
not being asked something like that.

712
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,569
"What do women want?

713
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,806
You know better than to ask. "

714
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,085
Give me a pen.

715
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,586
Jesus.

716
00:42:53,762 --> 00:42:55,389
"What do women want?"

717
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,461
"Any excuse to get closer. "

718
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,970
Thank God.

719
00:43:04,273 --> 00:43:07,106
There's that ego people pay to see.

720
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,549
I'll have the filet of sole.

721
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:18,847
Excellent.

722
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:21,286
Creamed spinach or creamed corn?

723
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,288
Spinach.

724
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,688
Fried potatoes or au gratin?

725
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,192
Au gratin. With tomato juice to start.

726
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:27,421
I'll have a goulash.

727
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,019
Very good, sir.

728
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:34,633
Vodka gimlet.

729
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,136
Old-fashioned.

730
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,737
How was your day?

731
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,644
Fine.

732
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,720
You know, I work with doctors.

733
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,412
They'll say anything you pay them to.

734
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:55,752
Of course, dear.

735
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:57,826
Dinner in the city.

736
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,484
I'm glad I'm hungry.

737
00:44:00,896 --> 00:44:03,558
<i>I saw an interesting thing
in the Journal American.</i>

738
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:04,724
Apparently, the phone company

739
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:08,963
wants to start charging people
for unlisted numbers.

740
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:10,629
That doesn't seem fair.

741
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:11,831
Some people agree with you,

742
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,407
and they're giving aliases to Ma Bell.

743
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:14,976
They call it the nom-de-phone.

744
00:44:15,077 --> 00:44:17,341
Isn't that smart?

745
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,142
Of course, most of them
are pornographic.

746
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,445
The best one?

747
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:24,519
Pat McGroin.

748
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,520
Oh, my God.

749
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,987
Hard to believe they could print that

750
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,887
<i>in the Journal American,
let alone a phone book.</i>

751
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:43,561
This is nice.

752
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,421
I'll be right up.

753
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,338
Hello.

754
00:45:24,446 --> 00:45:25,572
Sorry to bother you so late.

755
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,670
It's Don Draper.

756
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:28,272
Oh, hello, Mr. Draper.

757
00:45:28,383 --> 00:45:30,510
No, no. It's not too late at all.

758
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:32,484
Glad to hear that.

759
00:45:32,588 --> 00:45:34,112
Well?

760
00:45:34,223 --> 00:45:38,922
Well, I had a very interesting hour
with your wife this afternoon.

761
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,861
She's a very anxious young woman.

762
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:44,933
I think you're doing the right thing.
