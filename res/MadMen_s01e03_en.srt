1
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,064
Hey. Dick?

2
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:52,369
Richard Whitman?

3
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,646
Holy smokes, is that you?

4
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:58,749
As I live and breathe.

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,908
It's me. Larry.

6
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,753
Krisinski, L. Fort Sill?

7
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,586
Oh, of course. Larry, look at you.

8
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,421
Yeah, and you.

9
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,325
Still haven't filled out.
You must be a bachelor.

10
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,796
No.

11
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,958
Where are you at?
I'm out of Waltham, Mass.

12
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm just spending a day in Armonk
with International Business Machines.

13
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:20,929
I'm upstate.

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,870
Hey, I just saw Jerry Creighton.

15
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:24,805
Remember? Slept with a sidearm in his bunk.

16
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,639
Almost blew his jaw off?

17
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:29,339
Yeah, I remember that.

18
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,814
Yeah, well... Look, I should, uh...

19
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,817
Call me. We should catch up.

20
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:36,512
Absolutely.

21
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:37,849
Old Dick Whitman.

22
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:40,322
What are the chances?

23
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:09,410
Good morning, Hollis.

24
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,751
I mean, it's France.
What do they want with the bomb?

25
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:13,154
We must have given it to them.

26
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,192
No way the frogs
came up with it on their own.

27
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,920
- Hey, it's the honeymoon kid.
- Hey.

28
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,519
Here comes Romeo
without his roe, like a dried herring.

29
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,723
Do I seem different?

30
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,424
You do look depleted, Humps.

31
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:23,432
The wedding was great.

32
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:24,797
How was the rest of it?

33
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,427
You're talking about my wife here.

34
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,472
Oh, she's already got you there?

35
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:29,631
Gentlemen never discuss this.

36
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,402
We're talking about you here:

37
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,070
The man who told us
the coat check girl from "21"

38
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:36,511
had tangerine panties.

39
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,640
Come on, buddy boy, spill.

40
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,741
I don't know.

41
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:43,116
Something happened in the ceremony.

42
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:46,782
It's when he said that thing
about being new baptized.

43
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:49,486
I just felt this calm come over me.

44
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:52,256
So what you're saying is,
uh, a lot of missionary?

45
00:02:57,903 --> 00:02:59,734
Fine.

46
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:02,363
So she's laying there, right?

47
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,032
And she kept looking at the maps,

48
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,475
talking about all the things
we were going to do...

49
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,206
but we never did.

50
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,214
<i>Ladies Home Journal.
I can get that at Mom's.</i>

51
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,544
Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.

52
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,585
Well, hey, there.

53
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:16,881
The ring, it's like catnip.

54
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,118
Did you know that 600,000 gallons of water
go over the Falls per second?

55
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:22,193
Per second!

56
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,921
Oh, look. He's back.

57
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,394
Good morning.

58
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,931
- Congratulations.
- Welcome back.

59
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,625
Thanks, everybody.

60
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,133
When did this place get so friendly?

61
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,328
I guess people missed you.

62
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:34,268
- Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.
- Hildy.

63
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,036
Close the door!

64
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:42,045
Close the door!

65
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:46,378
Who put the Chinamen in my office?

66
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:48,850
Welcome back.

67
00:03:56,161 --> 00:04:00,120
They paid an Oriental family
to be in Mr. Campbell's office.

68
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:02,166
Someone will finally
be working in there.

69
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:13,605
Mr. Romano, Mr. Kinsey, and Mr. Crane
are here for your meeting.

70
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,546
Do you need a minute?

71
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,139
Do you need a minute? You must.

72
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:21,776
You keep moving the Secor laxative
discussion.

73
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,124
See what we did to Campbell's office?

74
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:29,924
What do we have?

75
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,130
Let me remind you, safe and reliable
would make me doze off

76
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,565
if I wasn't so blighted
by the scourge of constipation.

77
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,467
Well, what can I say? I'm blocked.

78
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,938
I told you he wouldn't
think that was funny.

79
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,303
I got one.

80
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,207
How 'bout "Secor. It's satisfeculant"?

81
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,143
Stay in the art department, Sal.

82
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,115
I'm just saying we can be funny,
like those Volkswagen people.

83
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,446
You see this yet?

84
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,610
I have.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,654
I don't know what I hate about it the most,

86
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,882
the ad or the car.

87
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,355
You know, they did one last year.

88
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,153
Same kind of smirk.
Remember "Think small"?

89
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,285
It was a half-page ad in a full-page buy.

90
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,658
You could barely see the product.

91
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,822
I don't get it.

92
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,455
Elvis just got back from West Germany.

93
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,363
Why not put him in it?

94
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:11,730
They must be getting results.

95
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:14,270
They keep going back to the well.

96
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,431
I want the Chinamen
out of the building by lunch.

97
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,974
I'm still waiting on my shirts.

98
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,871
You've seen this?

99
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,220
- I'm back now.
- I see that.

100
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,556
So...

101
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,724
I should be on the list for the meeting.

102
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,631
Oh, I just...

103
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,465
I didn't know when
you were coming back.

104
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:47,663
Right.

105
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,769
Yeah, well, it's today. Here I am.

106
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,575
They're all in there already. You can go in.

107
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,074
Peggy...

108
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,487
When I came over that night,

109
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,822
you know, before.

110
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:11,054
I was there.

111
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,563
You know...

112
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,258
I'm married now.

113
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,427
I know.

114
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:19,935
So...

115
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,873
Pete...

116
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:29,208
I understand.

117
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:30,474
It never happened.

118
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,748
You want me to buzz you in?

119
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,447
The door looks a little bit open.

120
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,526
Sorry about that.
I took the Chinese out of the building.

121
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,189
But I have a feeling in an hour

122
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,857
I'm gonna want
to take them out again.

123
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,797
Bernbach. He's a Jew.

124
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:59,206
If I were him, I wouldn't want
to help reindustrialize Germany.

125
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,709
Everybody's got a price.

126
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,177
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

127
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,804
Honesty. It's a great angle.

128
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,816
No chrome, no horsepower,

129
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,011
foreign, ugly.

130
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,348
Guess they went with their strengths.

131
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,582
- It is funny.
- It is?

132
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,884
'Cause I think the joke's on us.

133
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:17,018
You're supposed to look at that
and say it's a great car, not a great ad.

134
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:18,561
I laughed. I think it's brilliant.

135
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,994
Brilliant.

136
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,397
I'll tell you what brilliance
in advertising is: 99 cents.

137
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,661
Somebody thought of that, Campbell.

138
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:27,067
Well, say what you want. Love it or hate it,

139
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:30,573
the fact remains we've been talking
about this for the last 15 minutes.

140
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,134
<i>And this is Playboy.</i>

141
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,906
Of course, what we should have
been talking about is Secor laxative,

142
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:42,350
unless, as it appears,
there is nothing to say.

143
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,752
I don't want to hear this.

144
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,289
We're on the case.

145
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,588
Part of this job is doing things
you don't want to do.

146
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:50,820
Most of it.

147
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,968
It's good to be back, Draper.
I missed you.

148
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,333
Then it must not have been
much of a honeymoon.

149
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,769
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

150
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,970
How's married life?

151
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,569
It's pretty swell.

152
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,385
I was raised that men don't wear jewelry.

153
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,320
I kind of like it.

154
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,015
Trudy's a lot funnier than I thought.

155
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,456
I'm actually looking forward
to going home tonight.

156
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,619
Well, I look forward to meeting her.

157
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,762
Hey, maybe one of these nights

158
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:30,630
we could get dinner together
with the, uh, wives.

159
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:31,861
Maybe we can.

160
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,654
You know, girls, we'd be happy
to bring you coffee.

161
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,246
I was on my way over anyways.

162
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,553
I have something of yours.

163
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,222
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.
I finished it last night.</i>

164
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,696
Good to the last drop, right?

165
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,824
Well, I can see why it got banned.

166
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:05,835
Well, you don't have to be so shy about it.

167
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,234
It's literature.

168
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,703
That is a huge pocketbook, Joan.

169
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:12,003
Well, it's got a change of clothing
and a toothbrush in it.

170
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,577
A hope chest.

171
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,578
Have you read this, Peggy?

172
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,740
I don't think that's a good idea.

173
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,651
There's, um... this word in it a lot.

174
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:24,983
I know the word, Joan.

175
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,522
Well, it's sad, really,

176
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:28,990
because even with its reputation,
men won't read it.

177
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:30,424
And they really should.

178
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,018
I don't care if it's 500 years old.

179
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,031
It's another testimony to how
most people think marriage is a joke.

180
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,828
They rip a lot of clothing.

181
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,266
Yeah, it's a fantasy.

182
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,599
He's married, and she's married.

183
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,969
The desperate passion
of the forbidden.

184
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:44,598
Can I borrow it?

185
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,734
She's making it sound better than it is.

186
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,471
There's a few good parts, that's all.

187
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,844
And the book just opens
to those pages by itself.

188
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:54,682
Hey, don't read it on the train.

189
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:56,219
It'll attract the wrong element.

190
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:58,546
- Bye.
- Bye.

191
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,790
So the doctor says to him,
"I hope you're happy.

192
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,455
"While you were out
finishing a round of golf,

193
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,226
"your wife was in a horrible accident.

194
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,165
"She is gonna need 'round-the-clock care.

195
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,100
Bathing, toilet. "

196
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,933
Then the doc looks at him and says,

197
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,063
"I'm just kidding. She's dead.

198
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,436
Hey, what'd you shoot?"

199
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,169
...initial research report

200
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:22,212
and what I think are some very astute
market observations.

201
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,511
Mr. Draper.

202
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,382
Pleased to see you didn't disappear
the minute you cashed my check.

203
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,614
We appreciate your business.

204
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,122
Kenny, of course, you know.

205
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,419
Harry Crane, media.

206
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:38,359
And Mr. George Pelham over here,
who is from research,

207
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,522
and who has more degrees
than a Russian protractor.

208
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:42,259
That's quite an introduction.

209
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,426
From the other side of the pond, I see.

210
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,196
We take his word for it.

211
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,008
So, uh, that is yours to keep.

212
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,342
But if you'd like to follow along,
you'll see from the overview

213
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,816
our primary focus was Saks,
Henri Bendel, and Bonwit Teller.

214
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:03,682
Our research uncovered
a variety of options

215
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,224
they utilize to attract
your desired customers.

216
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:11,625
One thing these stores have in common
is a comfortable shopping environment.

217
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:14,027
Spacious, open sales floors,

218
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,896
An almost conspicuous lack of clutter.

219
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,366
Merchandise is minimal

220
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,872
and neatly presented on tables
and in display cases.

221
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:28,037
This "less is more" philosophy
is also evident in the window displays.

222
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:32,048
For example,
only one sweater to a window,

223
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,483
as opposed to windows
stuffed with merchandise.

224
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,417
My father's going to love that.

225
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,922
Believe it or not,
it even applies to the mannequins.

226
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,753
Bendel's takes the heads off theirs

227
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,123
so the shopper can imagine them
to be anyone.

228
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:45,718
Anyone without a head.

229
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,695
Along with these cosmetic changes,

230
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,361
you'll also need to provide
what we call boutique extras.

231
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,664
A personal shopping service,

232
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,170
private fashion shows,

233
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,706
and designer collections.

234
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,571
This is comprehensive.

235
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,507
It's the lay of the land.

236
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:04,172
Just from holding it, I feel more informed
about my competitors than ever.

237
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:09,583
And yet my store already has
a personal shopping service

238
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,019
and designer collections,

239
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:14,523
which makes me wonder
if you were so focused on my competitors

240
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,718
that you failed to visit my store.

241
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:20,294
I've been away on my honeymoon.

242
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:21,797
I've been there a few times.

243
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,891
It's a beautiful old place.

244
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,198
Miss Menken, I can assure you

245
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,712
that no one at this table
has ever been to your store.

246
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:38,976
A wrong I will personally correct
this afternoon.

247
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,384
It's right on 5th Avenue.

248
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:48,425
That's one big block over
and a dozen little blocks up.

249
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,827
It's been there for 30 years.

250
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,556
- I'll walk you out.
- I've got it.

251
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,502
Harry.

252
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,867
What?

253
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,001
It was nice
the way you handled that.

254
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,044
It's hard to get caught in a lie.

255
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,636
Well, it wasn't a lie.

256
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,011
It was ineptitude
with insufficient cover.

257
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,778
Something about the way
you talk always restores my confidence.

258
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,651
I have a deep voice.

259
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,417
This afternoon, then.

260
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,356
It's a date.

261
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:27,228
New junior exec.

262
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,597
Changing her store
could take six months...

263
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,040
or a year, if I know what's good for me.

264
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,941
- What was that in there?
- What?

265
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:44,241
Don and Molly Goldberg.
Did you see that?

266
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:45,838
Yeah, I caught it. What's your point?

267
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,815
I don't know. I mean,
everybody always jokes about it,

268
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,183
but I've never seen Draper
really turn that switch on before.

269
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,586
I guess he likes her. What would you do?

270
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:58,352
Trying to quit.

271
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,489
You are really putting the junior
in junior executive.

272
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,898
Look, you're married now, all right?

273
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:08,267
I'm a part of that club, too.
Two very happy years.

274
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,840
But when I'm out in the world...

275
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,807
I don't know. I don't do it much.

276
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,036
I'm not good at it...

277
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,908
The flirting, the double entendres...

278
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:17,708
You mean something on the side?

279
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:22,115
No. I mean enjoying
the company of women

280
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,154
in the limited way a married man can.

281
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:27,354
It's all we have, really.

282
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,722
I can't speak for everyone,
but it's plenty for me.

283
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,795
Same. I guess on some level,

284
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:33,727
I always thought Draper
was the same way.

285
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,264
Draper?

286
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,526
Who knows anything about that guy.

287
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,192
No one's ever lifted that rock.

288
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:41,032
He could be Batman for all we know.

289
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:44,301
Mr. Campbell,
you wife's on the phone.

290
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,342
There's bird shit on the couch.

291
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:47,843
That was priceless.

292
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,844
Hello, honey.

293
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,813
Dinner? Wow.

294
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,181
What do I want for dinner?

295
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,083
I don't know.

296
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,748
Anything but chicken.

297
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,983
Yes, they missed me.

298
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:04,619
Uh, rib eye in the pan with butter.

299
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,629
Ice cream.

300
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,289
I love you, too.

301
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:14,264
There's going to be dinner
waiting for me when I get home.

302
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,237
Yeah. How about that?

303
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,897
Mr. Kurland was mitigating a skirmish
in our housewares section.

304
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,835
Why do I hire young girls?

305
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,374
Because they cost practically nothing.

306
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,306
Costume change.

307
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,901
This is my closet.

308
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,711
The original tenants laid the last brick
the day before the crash.

309
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,684
Boy, were they in for a surprise.

310
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,049
As I hope you know by now,
our original store was just off 7th Avenue.

311
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,628
It was just hosiery.

312
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,993
Then they started pulling piecework
from sweatshops.

313
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,363
By 1932, these people had failed.

314
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:20,801
My father and uncle
picked this place up for a shekel.

315
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:23,305
Well, it is crowded.

316
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,671
But that might have
something to do with the sale,

317
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,142
which means that, if we're successful,

318
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:29,769
you're gonna lose
the customers you have

319
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,643
in order to get
the customers you want.

320
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,614
I was gonna start with raising prices.

321
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,583
Can you imagine what my father said?

322
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,449
Well, you do have
to give them something

323
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:38,920
for their higher dollar count.

324
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:42,982
It's just awfully hard to define what that is.

325
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:49,829
How may I help you?

326
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,596
I make them say that.

327
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:55,171
Carol, can we see this tray right here?

328
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,209
Sea horses,

329
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,442
crowns,

330
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,778
lucky dice.

331
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:11,047
Medieval knights.

332
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,633
That's better.

333
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:24,826
Thank you.

334
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,974
Let's take a look at the second floor.

335
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,085
We're known for our service.

336
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,747
That's gotta be a tough job.

337
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,984
I know.

338
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,926
I've always liked how quiet it is up here.

339
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,725
Well, that might explain the lack of customers.

340
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,597
I can see the charm, but...

341
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,638
the room is too dark, too old-fashioned.

342
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,071
The products look old.

343
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:05,437
But the people look wonderful.

344
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,869
It's a shame we're gonna
have to lop their heads off.

345
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,244
It'll ruin your favorite part of the store.

346
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,476
It's not my favorite part, actually.

347
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:32,265
The grand lot of us are going to Lansky's.

348
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:33,996
Can you believe it?

349
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,505
Have a swell time. I've got plans.

350
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,471
You look nice.

351
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,385
Hell.

352
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:59,224
Manhattan at your feet.
I can see the appeal.

353
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,820
The view's okay.

354
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,628
Now, this is my favorite part of the store.

355
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,530
Hey there, Missy.

356
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:10,637
Hey.

357
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,641
I haven't seen you in a while.

358
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:15,303
- Hey.
- How did they get the penthouse?

359
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,039
They patrol.

360
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:18,706
It's the only way to make sure

361
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:20,716
there isn't anyone hiding
in the store at night.

362
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:22,479
Well, they know I'm with you, right?

363
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:25,714
These two are Carla and Leona.

364
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,259
Not the originals, but third generation,

365
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
and what every generation
of Menken dog

366
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:36,026
shall be named until the end of time.

367
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,964
I made my father's
legal counsel add that

368
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:40,036
to the store's by-laws when I was 9.

369
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,503
So even then you enjoyed
telling men what to do.

370
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:46,064
To be fair, the store
was practically home.

371
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:48,372
My father liked to work.

372
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,777
I used to come out here
and talk to them...

373
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,007
well, the originals...

374
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,845
every night.

375
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,819
For a little girl,
a dog can be all you need.

376
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,948
They protect you. They listen.

377
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,458
I had my sister, but there weren't other kids.

378
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:07,053
And, of course,
my mother wasn't around.

379
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,758
Well, that's not always a bad thing.

380
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,028
Who knows?

381
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:14,036
She died when she was having me.

382
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,442
Anyway, my sister
became my only company.

383
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:20,908
And frankly,

384
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,979
these bitches were easier to handle.

385
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,983
What is this?

386
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,525
Don't try to convince me
that you were ever unloved.

387
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,385
I don't know what to say.

388
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,630
Listen...

389
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,567
I'm married.

390
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:37,316
I guess I didn't ask
'cause I didn't want to know.

391
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,456
That shouldn't have happened.

392
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,762
Well, you couldn't help yourself.

393
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:48,957
I knew what I wanted...

394
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,000
from the first time
you stormed out of our office.

395
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,126
You stormed out of your office.

396
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,907
I took you up here. That was stupid.

397
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,701
I just so looked forward
to seeing you again.

398
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,544
Now I guess that's over.

399
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,890
I know you understand

400
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:22,261
I'd rather not have to
explain this to anyone.

401
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,355
The account stays.

402
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,435
I just want someone else on it.

403
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:30,296
Don't look at me like that.

404
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,533
What do you do,
just kiss women all the time?

405
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,702
Women you aren't married to?

406
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,746
Of course not.

407
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:40,248
Well, then, am I supposed to live
some life running alongside yours?

408
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,150
I have some checks to sign.

409
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,802
Excuse me.

410
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:39,637
You dropped your paper.

411
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:44,137
Thank you.

412
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,342
Daddy!

413
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:22,976
Daddy! Daddy!

414
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,054
Wake up. It's my birthday.

415
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,588
It's my birthday!

416
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,055
It's my birthday!

417
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:30,888
It's not your birthday. It's your party.

418
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:32,222
Don, the party's at 2:00.

419
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:35,787
You have to put together
the P-L-A-Y-H-O-U-S-E.

420
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,058
How am I going to put together a pony?

421
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:42,104
A pony? I'm getting a pony?

422
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:44,299
Bobby, I'm getting a pony!

423
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,570
Great.

424
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:51,142
She'll forget all about it
when she sees the playhouse.

425
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,347
There's a bacon and egg sandwich
for you on the range.

426
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,506
It's got a red door like ours!

427
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:51,130
Daddy!

428
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,675
You are not supposed to see this yet.

429
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,439
Why don't you run to the garage
and get me another beer?

430
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:58,606
Okay.

431
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:06,580
Capers?

432
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,453
You want to pick those out of the rug?

433
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,288
Well, they look naked.

434
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:14,262
Well, the only thing
this one wants is raw hamburger.

435
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,764
What does that mean?

436
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,232
I think that's enough of that.

437
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:19,666
Well, how many are we?

438
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,328
Us, you...

439
00:26:21,438 --> 00:26:22,928
Carlton's with the kids. Make it quick.

440
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,133
The Darlings, Helen Bishop...

441
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:27,574
- You didn't.
- I had to.

442
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,270
She saw me buying balloons at the market.

443
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,903
- Didn't seem right.
- So what?

444
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:33,983
I just brought her the pie,
got my dish back at the end.

445
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:36,484
Have you seen her walking
up Downtree Ridge?

446
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:38,748
Where the hell is she walking to?

447
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:42,017
I don't know.

448
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,285
How old is her kid?

449
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,554
Kids.

450
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:46,788
The boy is 9.

451
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,797
I'm gonna say Gary, maybe Glen?

452
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,366
And the baby is a 2-year-old.

453
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,492
She said she was gonna
try and get a sitter.

454
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,594
I would.

455
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,696
It's probably a big event for her.

456
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,272
That man.

457
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,581
I know.

458
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,066
You didn't use the powder room, did you?

459
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,040
It will appear untouched.

460
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:09,403
Everyone's gonna be here soon.

461
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,481
Why don't you go up
and take a shower?

462
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:13,139
Want company?

463
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,685
Mint juleps. It's that time of year.

464
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:02,629
- Wonderful.
- I'm so thirsty lately.

465
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,227
Ready or not, here I come!

466
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:09,862
There's date nut bread,
cold turkey,

467
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,032
and Waldorf salad for the adults.

468
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:18,105
And I just made
peanut butter sandwiches for the kids.

469
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,944
I know everybody eats that.

470
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,711
Thank you.

471
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,718
And in case anybody's going to ask,

472
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,185
I did not get that clown.

473
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:26,653
- Oh.
- Oh.

474
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,691
He got booked in some off-Broadway show.

475
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:30,760
About clowns? I think we saw that.

476
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:34,024
It's not the one
where they take their clothes off, is it?

477
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:35,120
Who knew that could be boring?

478
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,259
Want something a little
stronger there, Carlton?

479
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:40,427
He'll manage.

480
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,027
We were thinking about you, Don.

481
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,097
We saw this thing on TV.

482
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,540
It was right in the middle
of the news. It was cute.

483
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:48,838
The guy flying with his hat on.

484
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:51,140
- Did you do that one?
- It was so cute.

485
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,376
- I think the man looks exactly like Henry.
- Except not as handsome.

486
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,043
I haven't seen that.

487
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,452
I'm going to go and leave
the kids' food out.

488
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,854
Let's not even bother
trying to get them to sit.

489
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,152
I'll co-pilot.

490
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,852
Heard a good one the other day.

491
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,859
No, Chet.

492
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:07,259
I'm gonna tell the joke.

493
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:09,662
Your wife and your lawyer
are drowning.

494
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,097
You have a choice to make:

495
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,669
You go to lunch or a movie?

496
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,067
It's good, right?

497
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,503
Hey, I'm missing the ball game.

498
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,164
I might as well have some fun.

499
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,799
Hey.

500
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,878
So how are things on Mad Ave, Don?

501
00:30:21,978 --> 00:30:24,105
Looks like they're taking care of you.

502
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:26,876
We got it all, huh?

503
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,780
Yep, this is it.

504
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:35,822
Maybe it's his obsession with sports,
but it's been hard for Jack.

505
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:38,861
Marilyn, I've been watching Kevin,
and he gets around very well.

506
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:43,155
I bet he doesn't know the difference.

507
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:44,494
He does.

508
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,592
He's very determined.

509
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:49,729
Jack really gets angry anytime someone
mentions the vaccine,

510
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,774
and I tell him we should be grateful.

511
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,934
First of all, it could
have been much worse.

512
00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:55,602
It could have gotten to his lungs.

513
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:58,340
Second of all, this can't happen
to other children.

514
00:30:58,448 --> 00:31:00,245
They think they're athletes.

515
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,749
I want to say to Chet,

516
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:04,013
"I saw you play football in high school.

517
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,180
Your son's going to
be a tackling dummy just like you. "

518
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:18,959
According to Glen here,

519
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:22,266
when the door's a little bit open,
you're supposed to come in.

520
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:24,272
Hello, Helen.

521
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:30,103
I hate to start with a bunch of excuses,
but the babysitter was late,

522
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:32,044
and I still haven't
unpacked all the boxes,

523
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:34,378
so this was the only paper I could find.

524
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:39,749
It should be Christmas all year
as far as I'm concerned.

525
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,251
<i>Ajury in New York City</i>

526
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,762
<i>is expected to receive
the tax evasion paper...</i>

527
00:31:49,232 --> 00:31:53,191
<i>...Opera's production
of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro,</i>

528
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:56,534
<i>with Robert Merrill and Joan Sutherland.</i>

529
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,040
Don, you have to pick up the cake
from Hightop.

530
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:02,509
Oh, and this is Helen Bishop and Glen.

531
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:03,772
Nice to meet you all.

532
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:07,415
Don. He goes with me.

533
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:10,486
Then Carlton, Chet, and Jack.

534
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:11,611
Glen, I'm pretty sure there are

535
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,120
some peanut butter
sandwiches and a BB gun

536
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,155
out there in the backyard.

537
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:15,656
Why don't you come with me?

538
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,557
Don, can I speak with you?

539
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,727
Let's see, I told you about the cake,

540
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,805
and... oh, can you take
some movies this time?

541
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,431
Of everyone or just Chief Tiny Tim?

542
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,670
You bought that camera,
and you always forget.

543
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,246
Okay.

544
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:45,781
Ladies, ladies, this is Helen Bishop.

545
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:47,686
- This is Marilyn.
- Nice to meet you.

546
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:48,780
And Nancy.

547
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:51,019
She seems scared, poor thing.

548
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:55,086
Trust me, those hens are
gonna peck her to death.

549
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:57,894
Do you see her running around
in that little Volkswagen?

550
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,298
That's kind of desperate.

551
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:01,461
That won't help her.
It's got no back seat.

552
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:03,300
She'll have to find some midget hitchhiker.

553
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,939
Last time I saw one of those,
I think I was throwing a grenade into it.

554
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:09,943
Yeah.

555
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:12,537
The problem with Easter break
is it's too long.

556
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,877
The doldrums.

557
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,817
We're thinking about seven days,
six nights, in Boca Raton,

558
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,013
with mosquitoes as big as a silver dollar.

559
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,387
And believe me, those aren't the only
giant noses you'll have to deal with.

560
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:24,255
Francine.

561
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,192
Carlton and I went
there on our honeymoon,

562
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,355
and all I can say
is we were outnumbered.

563
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,363
It's uncomfortable.

564
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,899
You want to be able to relax.

565
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,969
We went to Bermuda
on our honeymoon.

566
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:34,127
Pink sand beaches.

567
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,330
Where did you go?

568
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:40,270
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

569
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:44,945
It's okay. I went to Paris.

570
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:47,812
Four years of Mount Holyoke French.

571
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,407
Haven't used it since.

572
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:55,752
And I wouldn't give it back,
even being with Glen's father.

573
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,759
Is that your ex-husband?

574
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,519
Yes.

575
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,762
I went to Italy.

576
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,129
Not on my honeymoon,

577
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:07,965
but right after I graduated from Bryn Mawr.

578
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,265
What a summer.

579
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:10,498
<i>Three Coins in the Fountain.</i>

580
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:11,938
It was right about that time.

581
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,771
You must have loved Paris.

582
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:15,276
It's all walking.

583
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,005
What do you mean?

584
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:20,207
Just that I've seen you
walking around the neighborhood.

585
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:23,945
I've seen you, too, when I was driving.
I think I waved.

586
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:25,919
Where are you going
when you do that?

587
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,923
No place. I just like to walk.

588
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:33,552
But where?

589
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,494
Anywhere.

590
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:38,226
It just relaxes me and clears my mind.

591
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,461
I heard on the radio that Einstein did it.

592
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,130
Einstein? He's got
his hands into everything.

593
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:57,879
Sweetie.

594
00:34:57,987 --> 00:34:59,045
Hi, Daddy!

595
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:14,693
What are you, Frank Sinatra?

596
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:16,601
I was looking for Glen.

597
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:19,607
Bunch of them just ran through.

598
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:25,047
There are the boys.

599
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,877
How are we doing?

600
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:33,317
It's, uh, it's Helen, right?

601
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:37,785
I know your situation,

602
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:40,192
and my heart breaks for that little boy.

603
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:42,025
I have a baby, too.

604
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:44,226
You can act strong,

605
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:46,393
but I just want to volunteer.

606
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:47,595
If you ever need someone

607
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:49,763
to throw the ball
around with him some Sunday,

608
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:51,738
take him to the beach.

609
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:53,968
That would be nice.

610
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:58,471
I'm sure eventually I'd get so used
to your Sunday visits,

611
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:01,550
I'd join you at the beach,
just the four of us.

612
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,620
Then one night, you'd
drop us off at the house

613
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:07,417
and walk me in with an umbrella.

614
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:08,855
The kids would go to sleep,

615
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,789
and we'd laugh
about all the funny things

616
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:12,589
that happened at the beach that day.

617
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:14,856
I don't want you telling Francine

618
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,558
that I suggested
something that I didn't.

619
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,830
Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

620
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:07,080
You dented the car.

621
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,981
I like sleeping on the couch.

622
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:11,713
I don't like your tone.

623
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:14,016
Take your shoes off.

624
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:33,209
Interesting crowd in there.

625
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,713
Same crowd out here.

626
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,411
How about the Einstein thing?

627
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:45,578
I wonder if old Albert swung his hips
like that when he walked.

628
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:48,020
She probably got
her hair tips from him, too.

629
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:49,682
Glen is so quiet.

630
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,419
Not to mention wrinkled.

631
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:55,293
Maybe she hasn't unpacked
her iron, either.

632
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,492
Christmas paper? Please.

633
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:00,091
She works.

634
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:03,001
It has to be hard to run a house, too.

635
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,404
Manning a counter
at a jewelry store?

636
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:06,998
It's not that demanding.

637
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,137
I don't know. I had a job in sales
before I was a mom.

638
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,976
Have you seen my mom?

639
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,745
No, honey. Maybe she's
in the dining room.

640
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:20,549
Betty.

641
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:21,681
What?

642
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,201
Don, will you please go
to Hightop and get the cake?

643
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:51,719
Hey. Don't run in the house.

644
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:53,186
What is going on in here?

645
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,280
Your kid knocked over a drink.

646
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,485
You need to tell him
this is not a jungle gym.

647
00:38:58,594 --> 00:39:01,688
Ernie, did you hear what Mr. Farrelly said?

648
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:05,833
Did you say you were sorry?

649
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:07,664
Do you want some more?

650
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,500
No. Come on. He heard me.

651
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:13,598
Go get your mother
and have her clean this up.

652
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:53,806
Okay. Thank you.

653
00:39:57,253 --> 00:39:58,584
The woman at the bakery said

654
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,747
he picked up the cake
almost an hour ago.

655
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,950
Do you think he had an accident?

656
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,048
Let's go.

657
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,957
We haven't done birthday cake.

658
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:07,620
There's not going to be a cake.

659
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,789
Am I the only one that knows that?

660
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:15,436
Don Draper, you are a first class heel,
and I salute you.

661
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,062
Let's go.

662
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:19,539
Swell party. Food was delicious.

663
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:28,081
I might have a cake.

664
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:30,482
A Sara Lee in my freezer.

665
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:32,611
Well, could you go get it?

666
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,815
Please. That would be so great.

667
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,092
For she's a jolly good fellow

668
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:49,535
For she's a jolly good fellow

669
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:53,803
For Sally's a jolly good fellow

670
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:00,713
Which nobody can deny

671
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:04,048
Happy Birthday, little lady.

672
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,128
Daddy!

673
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,803
Mommy, Mommy, look!

674
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:34,672
Daddy got me a doggy!

675
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,042
I don't even know what to say.

676
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:42,481
I want to name her...

677
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:45,019
Polly! Polly doggy!

678
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:55,958
Come on.

679
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:00,433
Hey.

680
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,594
Hey.

681
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,837
Happy Birthday, baby.
